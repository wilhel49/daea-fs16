		 	Also known as the Mortuary Temple of Amenhotep III, Kom el-Hettan is located on the western bank of the Nile, close to Luxor. 
			 Built during the 18th Dynasty, it was the largest funerary complex of its time in the Thebes area. One of its most prominent 
		 	features is the Colossi of Memnon, two enormous statues of Amenhotep III located at the entrance to his temple complex.
		 	 Although very little of the large complex remains, many statues have been found, including icons of animals and various 
		 	 gods and goddesses. The most prominent god depicted is Sekhmet, with hundreds of her statues found.

		<h3>Location</h3>
		<hr>
		<p>
			Kom el-Hettan is located on the western bank of the Nile, across from the ancient city of Luxor. 
			The temple of Hatshepsut at Deir el-Bahri can be found just a mile away, with the Valley of Kings and the Valley 
			of Queens nearby. Today, it is almost completely surrounded by lush farmland and many trees grow on the premises. 
			Because of its proximity to the Nile, the yearly flood has had a negative impact on the site and has more rapidly decayed 
			any artifacts that may have been otherwise discovered.
		</p>

			Amenhotep III’s mortuary complex consists of three large courts, with just one being nearly four times the size of his 
			second largest construction, his temple to Amun at Karnak in Luxor. Combined with the other courts, this makes it the largest 
			complex ever to be built in ancient Egypt at any time. The temple faces east, to honor the rising sun, the god Amun Re. 
			</p>
			<p>
			The main entrance is flanked by two massive colossi, most famously known as the Colossi of Memnon. They rise up to over twenty 
			meters in height and are made of quartzite (O'Connor, D. B., & Cline, E. H., 1998). They are styled in the image of Amenhotep 
			III and have, at each base, a statue of Queen Tiy, his wife, on the left of his legs and Queen Mutemwiya, his mother, to the 
			right. There were also thought to be figures of a favorite daughter betweenhis ankles, but most traces of these statues have 
			long since been destroyed by either erosion or looters. In addition, the colossi would have been decorated beautifully with 
			bright colors, but today, most traces of these facades have faded. Beyond these imposing figures is the long Hypostyle Hall,
			 which leads to the Peristyle Sun Court and sanctuaries that were dedicated to various gods and goddesses such as Amun, Mut, 
			 and Khonsu. The Sun Court, in turn, was divided into a Northern and Southern Sun Court, which contain many statues of 
			 Amenhotep III and various gods.
			</p>
			<p>
			The entire complex is surrounded by a wall made of brown quartzite from Lower Egypt on the North side and red granite from 
			Aswan (in Upper Egypt) on the South side. The statues were thought to line these walls and include at least 40-42 images of 
			Amenhotep III himself, sphinxes, crocodiles, and many statues of Sekhmet (Sourouzian, 2008). The Sekhmet statues are 
			particularly of note for their sheer quantity and the wide distribution of artifacts in museums around the world. These venues 
			include the Vatican Museum in Rome, Italy and the Louvre Art Museum in Paris, France. To the south of the sanctuaries to the 
			gods, Amenhotep III placed a temple designed to personally venerate himself, the pharaoh, after his death.  
			</p>
			<p>
			Throughout the years, floodwaters, irrigation, erosion, and general neglect has made the site very difficult to excavate. Earthquakes 
			seem to also have been a major factor in the destruction of the site in ancient times. Many of the stone blocks were used by later 
			pharaohs to build their own funerary complexes and monuments nearby, including that of Merenptah, Ramses III’s Medinet Habu, and the Roman 
			Pylon at Medinet Habu (Sourouzian, 2008). In addition to reusing building materials, some pharaohs recognized the quality of 
			statuary present in the complex and reused the artwork in their own temples and monuments. It is thought that multiple colossi 
			at Karnak and other temples in Luxor are actually originally from Kom el-Hettan, based on the materials used, style, and 
			craftsmanship, but have re-sculpted faces to reflect the current pharaoh’s image. This would suggest that there were possibly many more 
			colossi at Kom el-Hettan than are currently there and would make the site a much more important site than previously thought.

		<h3>Excavations</h3>

		<br>
		<p>
			There have been multiple excavations of Kom el-Hettan, including several major ones within the last twenty years and a 
			few rudimentary ones in the late 1900s. One of the most recent and significant excavations in the early 2000s was headed 
			by Dr. Hourig Sourouzian, who is currently the Director of the Colossi of Memnon and Amenhotep III Temple Conservation 
			Project (Sourouzian, 2008). Laurent Bavay also conducted an excavation in the 1999-2002 excavation seasons. 
		</p>
		<br>
		
		<h3>Results and Significance of Excavations</h3>
		<hr>
		<p>
			The most significant excavation that has been carried out at Kom el Hettan was conducted by Dr. Hourig Sourouzian in the mid 
			to late 2000s. The first major task was to restore and preserve the Colossi of Memnon that flanked the first pylons into the 
			complex. The northernmost statue had collapsed centuries ago and cracking was a major problem. The research team first cleaned 
			the colossi of any dirt and pollution that might have accumulated by the passage of time. They were also able to reconstruct 
			and reattach multiple pieces that had broken off and were scattered around the site. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Beyond the massive statues, a second destroyed pylon was discovered to also have two colossi guarding it, although these were 
			smaller and much more inconspicuous. One on the North side was exposed and badly eroded, while the South statue was in fairly 
			good condition, as it was covered by sand and mud. 
		</p>
		<p>
			A third pylon was found and, again, flanking colossi were unearthed. Unlike the previous pairs, which were made from quartzite 
			sandstone, these were constructed from alabaster. Due to the material they were carved out of, the statues were in much worse 
			condition than the others. Although the team sought to preserve them, funding was lacking and so only minor restorations were 
			completed. 
		</p>

		<img src="images/red_granite_head.jpg" width="100%"/>

		<figcaption><a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Awad, M. (2010, February 28). [Discovery of a red granite head wearing the crown of Upper Egypt]."
		>Image 4</a> - "Discovery of a red granite head wearing the crown of Upper Egypt"</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<p>
			The team also unearthed many statues and figures lining the complex and court walls. These include two new sphinxes guarding 
			the entrance to a small side courtyard, 87 statues of Sekhmet (both in a sitting and standing position), and an unprecedented 
			small sculpture of Queen Tiy, made from sandstone with inlayed eyes and eyebrows. In addition, other statues of Amenhotep III 
			were found that match an earlier find of a head in the late 19th Century and is currently on display at The British Museum 
			(Collection Online, n.d.). They are carved from quartzite and wear the crown of Lower Egypt. The team also uncovered opposing
			 statuary on the other end of the Court. These are crafted from red granite and wear the crown of Upper Egypt. They would have 
			 made an impressive and humbling sight to anyone who saw them, reinforcing the power the pharaoh had over the whole land.
		</p>
		<p>
			Throughout the excavation, it was made clear that water damage was a major problem that had to be addressed to better conserve 
			the site. During the 2008 season, five large pumps were brought in to move the ground and irrigation water away from the site 
			to a location a few hundred meters away in a nearby field. This will hopefully slow the process of decay and will allow further
			 excavations to be carried out much more easily. 
		</p>
		<p>
			There were also a few excavations by Laurent Bavay, which unearthed many pieces of pottery. A few stelae were also found 
			near the entrance to the Sun Court, which may chronicle the building achievements of Amenhotep III.
		</p>
		<br>
		
		<h3>Conclusion</h3>
		<hr>
		<p>
			Although it is badly damaged and decayed, Kom el-Hettan is a major site in understanding the role of various gods and 
			pharaohs in a mortuary context, as well as how subsequent pharaohs reused art and construction materials in their own 
			monuments. Because of its large size, it has many secrets to explore and discover, and excavations, restorations, and 
			preservations are still being carried out today.
