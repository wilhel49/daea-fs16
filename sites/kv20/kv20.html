      <h1>KV20</h1>
      <h3>New Kingdom</h3>
	  <h4>Maura A Timmons</h4>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
        <p>Hatshepsut (18th Dynasty) held both the title of a queen and a pharaoh during her lifetime. She had two tombs built for her, the original was KV20 and the later tomb was KV60. KV20, however, only briefly held the final resting place of Hatshepsut. This was largely due to later pharaohs removing the royal remains of individuals buried in the Valley of the Kings to safer locations in the attempt to protect their predecessors’ physical remains from looters. Just recently her remains were identified from a known artifact, Hatshepsut’s canopic box, which was recovered from KV20 by Howard Carter in the early 1900s.
        The site itself has only been entered a handful of times due to the dangerous conditions of the tomb. Compared to later tombs, KV20 is strikingly bare, but its sheer length and depth surpasses the other tombs in the Valley of the Kings. KV20 was one of the first tombs built in the Valley of the Kings, which gives reason as to why there is a lack of reliefs and overall text lining the walls. Hatshepsut set the standard for the later New Kingdom pharaohs in terms of architectural design for her tomb as well as other monuments she commissioned.</p>

      <h3>Location and Geography</h3>
      <hr>
        <p>KV20 is located at the base of a cliff on the Eastern side of the Valley of the Kings, in the direction of Hatshepsut's mortuary temple at Deir el- Bahri. Inside the tomb, it has been noted as incredibly steep as well as having an impressive depth and length (Carter). The different stratum layers in the stone created a unique difficulty when it was first excavated by Howard Carter in 1903.
          The first stratum was limestone, which made the entrance stable when excavations began. The second stratum, however, is made up of marl, which is an unstable sedimentary rock that caused a number of cave-ins throughout the tomb (Carter). KV20, as a result, has been described as the most dangerous tomb within the Valley of the Kings. The tomb has never been open to the general public and only a select few are ever granted permission to enter KV20.</p>
        <br>

     <h3>Description of The Site</h3>
     <hr>
      <p>The most detailed description of the site comes from Howard Carter. The tomb itself is located at the base of a limestone cliff, which separates her mortuary temple at Deir el- Bahri from the Valley of the Kings. The entrance, itself, is long sloping passage (approximately 50m in length) that eventually leads to a rectangular chamber (8m. length x 7m. width).
        The average height of both the passageway and the chamber is roughly two meters. Halfway down this passageway two protruding doorjambs with sockets in the walls for timber are noted in Carter’s field notes as being used to lower the sarcophagus and among other heavy items into the tomb. The middle of the first chamber includes steep descending stairs that are approximately 9 meters in length. The base of the stairs begins the second section portion of the tomb. It begins with a passageway (52m. in length and approximately 2-2.5m in height) the chamber is overall oddly shaped (7m x 3.25m x 2.75m).
        Halfway through this passageway the limestone stratum ends and the marl or tafle stratum begins. Similarly, this chamber also has a descending staircase (8m in length) leading to the third section in the tomb. The third passageway is 60.25 meters in length and the third chamber being 10m x 9m x 4.40m. In the third chamber, Howard Carter, observed three distinct strata, which includes ancient filling, a water deposit, and the debris from the collapsed ceiling (the order is from bottom to top).
        The fourth, and final, passageway (12m in length) led directly to the Sepulchral Chamber. The final chamber is a rectangular shape (11m x 5.5m x 3m) with three longitudinally columns that were meant to support the ceiling placed in the middle. On the further end and left-hand wall were entrances to three additional chambers, which were rectangular and very small.</p>
        <br>

     <h3>Exacavations Conducted at KV20</h3>
     <hr>
      <p>Howard Carter began his excavation in early February 1903. Majority of the spring was spent clearing debris that was swept in from the occasional rainstorms. Over the course of hundreds of years this debris cemented together, which make the excavation even more difficult.  Carter and his team cleared the first portion of the tomb by the end of February.  The finding of the protruding doorjambs and wall sockets for the wood gave evidence to Carter and his team that it was a genuine tomb. This second portion of the tomb was difficult to excavate due to the condensed debris and switch in strata. It took until April 15th to fully excavate this section. Both Carter and his team greatly feared that the rock in this new stratum would fail and cause a cave-in.
        Upon approaching the third section in the tomb, Carter and his team temporarily stopped their excavation due to the heat and lack of ventilation throughout the tomb.  Work began again on October 15th, but even so, shortly after they started the air became unbearable and Carter was obligated to install an air-exhaust. It took Carter and his until January 26, 1904 to clear this third passage and begin his work on the third chamber. The rubbish and debris in the passageway was entirely compact and the team had to resort to the use of pickaxes to continue onward.
        The third chamber was only partially filled with debris, but the ceiling, however, had collapsed at some point in time.  In the corner of this chamber was another set of descending stairs that led to the final section of the tomb.
 T      he fourth passageway took until February 11th to fully excavate and along this passageway mortuary objects were found. Some of the artifacts retrieved include mortuary furniture, viz., and fragments from stone vases with cartouches of Aahmes Nofritari, Thoutmosis I, and Hatshepsut. The condition of these artifacts most likely indicates that the tomb had been robbed at an earlier time. By February 12th Howard Carter and his team entered the final chamber.  They were disappointed to find that the ceiling collapsed and it being filled with debris. On March 10th the entire chamber was cleared with the addition of three side chambers.</p>
      <p>Catharine Roehrig and her colleagues conducted a mapping project on KV20 that was published in the text <em>Hatshepsut: From Queen To Pharaoh</em> in 2005. The project was organized through the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, to correctly identify Hatshepsut’s artifacts stored in multiple museums.
        The focus of this project was to fully analyze the art, architectural design, and artifacts and apply it to the reconstruction of Hatshepsut’s life story. The actual reentering of KV20 had only one purpose, to re-map the tomb for accuracy and for comparison to other tombs, including KV60.</p>
      <p>Zahi Hawass did the most current ‘excavation’ when he was the Secretary General of the Supreme Council of Antiquities in Egypt. He and his team identified the correct mummy that was in storage at the Cairo museum by a tooth comparison test. The tooth, recovered by Howard Carter and his team in the early 1900s when excavating KV20, was found in a canopic box along with several other organs. The mummy had been recovered from Howard Carter in KV60.
        They also did an mtDNA test with an already identified mummy, Ahmose Nefetari, which was proven to be Hatshepsut’s grandmother by the results. Upon identification, her remains were CT scanned to look at pathologies and among other things (Keller and <em> Discovery of Queen Hatshepsut</em>). Currently the tomb is closed off due to preservation efforts and due to the unstable condition of the stone strata.</p>

      <h3>Results and Significance of Excavations</h3>
      <hr>
        <p>Howard Carter was the first archaeologist to fully excavate KV20 and recover the artifacts from the tomb.  Found the sarcophaguses of Hatshepsut and Thutmosis I, and Hatshepsut’s canopic box, which were all sent to the Cairo Museum. It wouldn’t be for another about hundred years for archaeologists to use the canopic box to correctly identify Hatshepsut’s remains.
          In a more modern context, Catherine Roehrig and her colleagues helped create social awareness through the creation of public exhibits. Their main objective was primarily to reconstruct Hatshepsut’s life while also disproving past biases about this Queen and Pharaoh.
          Lastly, Zahi Hawass and his associates discovered Hatshepsut had diabetes, but she most likely died from cancer around the age of fifty-five. This could be the reason as to why she was a little bit fat compared to other mummies. </p>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <hr>
        <p>The first person to fully excavate and document their findings of KV20 was Howard Carter and his team. He began his excavation during the spring of 1903 and completed their work by March 1904. The actual excavation of this tomb was exceedingly difficult due to the geological layers of stone and the sheer depth and length of it.
          The walls in KV20 were not designed to be decorated with reliefs or writing. Carter and his team recovered very few artifacts, which is likely due to grave robbers. Other scholars have done follow up research, such as Zahi Hawas and Catherine Roehrig, to try to fully comprehend the identity of Hatshepsut.  Through their research, initiatives have begun to explain and educate the public on this long forgotten Queen and Pharaoh.
          Hatshepsut had a monumental impact on later pharaohs in the New Kingdom in terms of architectural design, which becomes evident through the abundance of later pharaohs choosing the Valley of the Kings as their final resting place. </p>
