		 <p>Ismant el-Kharab is located in the Dakhla Oasis, one of only seven oases in Egypt.  It is also known as the ancient Kellis site and was occupied during the late Roman or Ptolemaic Period.  This time period is named after Ptolemy I Soter who was king of Egypt between 305 B.C. and 282 B.C.  The first detailed excavation of this site happened in 1981 by the Dakhla Oasis Project.  There are four main areas that were excavated along with two main tomb groups and two cemeteries.  There is also the only known temple dedicated to the deity Tutu in Egypt found at this site.  There have also been many churches, residential areas, and even a bath house found at this site.</p>
			
		<h3>Location and Geography</h3>
			<hr> 
		<p>The Dakhla Oasis is located in Upper Egypt in the Western Desert of Egypt in the New Valley Governorate.  It is 220 miles from the Nile River and measures about 50 miles east to west and 16 miles north to south.  There are several communities within the oasis including Ismant el-Kharab which was known as Kellis in ancient times.  The village of ancient Kellis is about 1.6 miles southeast of present day Ismant.  The climate, like the majority of Egypt, is a hot and dry desert climate which is great for preservation.</p>

		<h3>Description of Site</h3>
			<hr>
			<p>The site of this village was about 3,440 feet by 2,130 feet.  The site has been divided into four main areas: Area A, which is towards the center of the site; Area B, which is north of Area A; Area C, which is east of Area B; and Area D, which is west of Area A.  There are also two main tomb group, the north tomb group and the south tomb group, as well as two cemeteries, the east cemetery and the west cemetery.  The north tomb group is located in the northwest area of the site and the south tomb group is located in the southwest area of the site.  Both cemeteries are located on the far east side of the site.
			<br>
		<h3>Excavations and Results</h3>
		<hr>
			<p> This site was noted and observed by early travelers and Egyptologists.  Some of these include Bernardino Drovetti, John Gardner Wilkinson, Herbert Eustis Winlock, and Ahmed Fakhry (Monash University).  The first excavations weren't done until 1981 by the Dakhla Oasis Project.  This was during an extensive archaeological survey of the oasis.  They divided the area into sections and each section has some interesting finds. </p>

				<img src="img/ismant-el-kharab2.jpg"width="100%" /> <figcaption><a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World as part of the Ancient World Image Bank. Kellis 2004 (XXIII). Flickr, accessed 27 October 2016.">Image 3</a> - "Interior of the large East Church in Area A" </figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p> Area A was mostly a residential area that contains five known houses.  This area also contains a few churches.  Houses one, two, and three were connected together into a single building.  They each had kitchens and ovens, cupboards and shelves.  There has also been many well preserved artifacts in these houses including ceramics, glass, baskets, sandals, and even some furniture.  They also found wooden mallets as well as some well preserved papyri inscribed with Greek and Coptic.  Inside house two, they found two books with their original binding.  The first book was the "Cyprian Orations of Isocrates the Orator - perhaps the earlies surviving copies of sections of his work dating to the early 4th century CE" (Monash University).  The second book was an agricultural account book which dates to the 3rd-4th century CE. </p>
			<br>
			<p> House four is made with mud-brick and has 20 rooms including staircases.  Within this house, there was an abundance of artifacts including fine glassware, figurines, household items, as well as "41 fragments of inscribed wooden boards, approximately 600 pieces of Greek papyri, 14 ostraka and 123 coins" (Monash University).  Many of these date to the 3rd and 4th centuries.  House five is very similar to house four but extensive excavation of the house could not be done as parts of the supporting walls were starting to crumble.  The large east church that was found in Area A was found to be made from "mud brick with gypsum coating on the inner walls of the body of the church, the columns and the main features" (Bowen).  This church was very well preserved.  Within some of the rooms of the church, they found potsherds, coins, and surprisingly, painted glass. </p>
			<br>
			<p> Area B is located north of Area A and is defined by three large buildings.  The function of the first structure is unknown.  It contains over 200 rooms and could have acted as an administrative building.  There is also evidence that it was used, in part, as a stable at one point for donkeys, goats, sheep, and camels.  One of the most interesting finds, though, of this area is the building known as the "painted residence".  The first excavations of this building didn't take place until 2005 and went until 2007.  This building consists of a large central room surrounded by dozens of smaller rooms.  Many of the walls of these rooms are covered in paintings.  The paintings range from flowers, to geometric shapes, to faces.  The third building in this area is known as the Columbarium.  This is believed to have been a stable.  Within this building, artifacts found include baskets, pieces of leather, and even some animal harnesses. </p>
			<br>
			<p> Area C consists of three mounds separated by shallow depressions.  This area is different because only traces of mud-brick walls were visible on the surface.  Because of this, buildings cannot easily be determined but examination of ceramics found show that this area predates Area A.  This area also contains remnants of the start of an unfinished temple which dates to the 1st and 2nd centuries.  There is also evidence that this area was a domestic quarter where some industrial activity took place including pottery manufacturing, iron smelting, and glass manufacturing (Monash University). </p>

Kellis 2004 (IX). Flickr, accessed 9 November 2016">Image 4</a> - "Wall and interior of the temple of Tutu" </figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p> Area D is located on the west side and contains a main temple.  This temple is dedicated to the deities Tutu, Neith, and Tapshay.  This is the only known surviving temple in Egypt that is dedicated to Tutu.  Ancient Kellis "was the cult centre [sic] for the worship of the god Tutu (Tithoes)...who warded off evil and is represented either as a sphinx or in human form" (Monash University).  Along with this temple, there is a church, a separate temple that was also dedicated to Neith and Tapshay, and some tombs.  The second temple is located behind the main temple.  Within this temple are many paintings that depict kings and pharaohs giving offerings to gods and goddesses.  The church located at this site was heavily eroded on some walls but other walls were better preserved.  There were not many artifacts found in this church, but the ones that were found include some coins, ceramics, baskets, glass sherds, jars, ivory knobs, and an incense burner.  Some fragments of papyrus were also found here.  The west tombs that were found in Area D date to the first centuries of Roman rule and only one out of the two remains preserved.  The architectural style of the chambers of these tombs are very non-Egyptian.  Almost a dozen human remains were found in the tomb that was preserved and they date to the 3rd-4th centuries.  All of the remains appear to have been disturbed. </p>
			<br>
			<p> The north and south tomb groups are very near to each other on the far eastern side of this site.  The north tomb group is made up of at least 20 known tombs with two of them being larger and more elaborate than the rest.  The largest tomb in this group, named North Tomb 1, is isolated from the rest of the tombs.  It was first recorded and photographed by Herbert Eustis Winlock in 1908.  The pictures that were taken within the tomb showed that the central chamber was decorated with Pharaoh-like mortuary scenes.  Since then, the majority of the tomb had deteriorated.  As a result, most of these pictures and paintings are no longer able to be seen.  This tomb was excavated by Monash University between 2000 and 2001.  Within the tomb, an estimated 35 individuals were found.  Some of the bodies were complete while some were disarticulated and disturbed with one grave being completely empty.  It is believed that most of these bodies were those of Christians.  The other large tomb in the north tomb group, known as North Tomb 2, was also documented and photographed by Herbert Eustis Winlock in 1908 and excavated by Monash University between 2000 and 2001.  Parts of this tomb had been dug up, most likely by looters and grave robbers.  There were some artifacts left behind including some pottery that dates to the 2nd and 3rd centuries.  There were also some remains found in this tomb including that of an infant.  One room of this tomb had an apparent fire that destroyed much of what was in it.  The south tomb group contains a rather elaborate and well preserved tomb at Ismant el-Kharab.  The ceramics found in the south tomb group date to the 2nd and 3rd centuries. </p>

		<h3> Conclusion </h3>
		<hr>
			<p> While Ismant el-Kharab, or ancient Kellis, may be a smaller site, it contains some very spectacular findings.  While this site dates to a much later time in Egyptian history, it still contains important parts of the Egyptian story.  Much of this site is less Egyptian and more Roman which suggests that the ancient Egyptians in this location during this time period were being very heavily influenced by the Romans.  This site was a religious center for the worship of Tutu which is important because there are no other known temples for this.  While there is evidence of heavy looting and plundering in certain parts of this site, there has been great preservation of artifacts including many works of writings.  These writing, while more Romanized, give some more detail and insight into what the life style was like during this time. </p>
