Karnak precinct of Montu is a very large temple located in northern Egypt near the east bank of Thebes. The temple is housed along with the Temple of Harpe, the Temple of Maat, as well as a few other small temples.  The Temple of Montu is one of the most important sites within Karnak in all of Egypt. Karnak is  open-air museum now, and it is said to be the second   largest ancient religious site in the world, after the Angkor Wat Temple of Cambodia.  The temple of Karnak is a special monument and has characteristics that are different than most temples. One of it’s most unique qualities is that it has housed up to around thirty pharaohs. Karnak was originally a temple that was built for King Amun, "the patron god of Thebes." As time went on temples became a huge cultural aspect and dominated the city of Thebes. Temples were just starting to be built in the Middle kingdom, and they were successfully built all the way up into the Roman times. The most important temples were located within the area of Karnak, which were separated into three sacred precincts dedicated to three different Theben gods; Amun, Mut and Montu. Montu was located north of the Amun and was called the “Apolloneion” in Greek. The Montu was known to be a falcon headed god of war and the patron god of Thebes.

 Montu had two other important establishments outside of the Theban area such as modern Medamud about eight kilometers away, which was an “age old cult place of Montu. Ptolemies came and built two temples for their god in place of an old sanctuary. Another temple of Montu was located in Touphium (Tod), which is about twenty miles outside of Thebes. Montu was known as the true lord of the west bank with his most important temple located at Hermonthis. The sanctuaries were closely related to each other and were said to both express the same iconography and onomastics. Each sanctuary in Montu had believed in the sacred bull known as “Buchis.” “The importance of the Montu bull was that it testified of the frequent occurrence of theophoric names, deprived of the name of the Buchis bull, from his name or his epithets, or from the name of Apollo, who was the counterpart of Montu.” When the last bull died in 340 CE, it was buried with an epitaph in hieroglyphics which was found to be the youngest surely dated text in the script." (Blyth)

 The Temple of Montu had more of a traditional scheme of Ancient Egyptian architecture. It was full of pillars and court rooms that were filled with rows and rows of columns. The ruins of the Temple of Montu date back to the reign of Amenhotep III who ended up rebuilding the temple and decided it should also be dedicated to Ramesses, so at one point it was renamed Montu-Re.  The construction of the temples started in the early Middle Kingdom, and pharaohs continued to add buildings, statues and temples
up throughout the New Kingdom. Over time the temple just continued to grow and eventually became a large group of combined temples.The Precinct of Montu is the smallest of the four and is most known for it’s gateway that was originally built by Ptolemy III and Ptolemy IV. Leading up to the gate there are rows of prodigious sphinx statues as well as a wharf where ships would load and unload resources and exchange goods. The temple started as a modest temple but as new pharaohs took throne changes continued to be made. Over time, pharaohs saw temples as their way to show their wealth, power and a way their increase in richness.

Throughout my research I have read many interesting stories regarding the evolution of the Temple of Montu's history. It seemed as though Pharaoh's were unable to control the throne for extended periods of time, which may be due to lack of leadership or just not being qualified to rule. Like in today's society, drama was a common influence and was always taking place throughout the Karnak halls. Rulers would often fall for reasons that both do and do not make sense. Often when a ruler had done an intolerable thing, they were often excised from history completely. They would be completely erased from all stories and all depictions of them would be distorted. There have been findings of relief scenes in Montu that have been erased of the Queen of the eighth pylon, as well as complete destruction of all her reliefs in all the rooms that she had constructed. Every image of her face was dismantled and destroyed, and evidences of all this destruction is still there today. Historians have interpreted these destructions as a possible attempt at revenge from Thutmose III against his aunt (the queen of the eighth pylon) that he hated due to her taking the throne right from under him.Something I found fascinating about Karnak, is that there stands statues of Amenhotep IV and the queen, but unlike the traditional statues of kings, queens and their families this statue was unique. The traditional statues of the kings were sculpted with an athletic and idealized body, but instead, this king wanted his statue to portray the real resemblance of his frame. So lined up in the front of the courtyard stood a large statue with the king having a “protruding belly, and elongated face, a narrow, high waist, and a thick, lush mouth."(Riggs) These structures were not only of the king, but he had the real resemblance of all the royal family members as well.

 In 1940 the French Archaeological Institute in Cairo (IFAO) began excavations and studies in the Temple of Montu and are still going on today.  One of the only structures that are still standing at the Temple of Montu today is a 18.75 meter high and 10.96 meter wide gate. On the other side of this gate, one would find a large courtyard which has been decorated by a colonnade dating back from the 25th dynasty during the Kushite period.    Excavations believe that the gate is very similar to the architecture at the  temple of Khonsu .  After further research excavators found an interesting discovery,
determining that the gate is divided into four registers, which is a number that is sacred to the Temple of  Montu .  Excavators have found many other artifacts such as a carving in a slate of the king, wearing a white crown and, offering vessels of wine to  Montu .At the end of the New Kingdom, the eastern part of the temple collapsed and was reconstructed by Taharqa (pharaoh of Ancient Egypt,  son of  Piye , the Nubian king of Napata   who had first conquered Egypt) . Taharka built a portico structured wall, which was arched and wasn’t really considered true a gate. So after a while the gate was dismantled by the Ptolemies, who rebuilt it with a proper enclosure of the wall. Karnack temples hold a lot of unique evidence that help improve the world drastically. Finding these ancient ruins is extremely important to archaeology and for understanding as well as learning the importance about prehistoric times and what events took place. There were no written records to read or study back in ancient times, what we have is what was left behind from these Ancient civilizations. This helps us understand Ancient Egyptians history on culture and shows us the way that they lived and the goals that they wanted to accomplish. It also gives us a better understanding on how the human race has changed and evolved throughout time.It wasn't until the 19th century that we really began using archaeology to accurately learn about the history of our past civilization. This is exciting because we are continuously learning more about our history and our technology is continuing to increase and soon enough we may have a clear understanding on a vast majority of our ancient history. The more evidence that is found the more thought and reconstruction takes place regarding political, religious and our military history. The more that we give effort in understanding the changes that have taken place in sites such as the Temple of Montu over time, the more we will understand what life really consisted of in the past. It will also help our country substantially grow together as a whole.The research on the temple of Montu relates to our class in multiple ways. It helped me gain a greater understanding about the importance of research and how understanding the past can affect our country's future. Each bit of evidence that is found tells a story, and these stories are the way we learn about culture. While many of these mysteries may remained unsolved, these bits of evidence, stories and carvings are all the ways they communicate with us, and an attempt to show us how they accomplished some of the magnificent work they did.
