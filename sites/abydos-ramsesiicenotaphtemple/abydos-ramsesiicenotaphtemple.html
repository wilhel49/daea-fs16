      <h1>Abydos, Ramses II Cenotaph Temple</h1>
      <h3>19th Dynasty 1279 - 1213 BC</h3>
	  <h4>Kerry Berres</h4>
    <br>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>Located in Abydos is Ramses II's Cenotaph Temple. It is made from pink and black granite and limestone. It is known for its colorful reliefs of battle scenes and scenes depicting offerings to gods and the king. The site is mostly in ruins, but the floor plains and lower walss remain, including the reliefs and some structures. The first excavation occurred in the first half of the 1800s and the most thorough excavation occurred in 1967.</p>
         <h3>Geographical Setting</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
		 <p>The Cenotaph Temple of Ramses II is located in Abydos, which was the eighth nome in Upper Egypt. It is located 6.8 miles west of the Nile. Abydos became a sacred site for pharaohs as a royal necropolis. There were several temples built through the period from the 1st Dynasty to the 30th Dynasty. However, there are three major constructions that remain today, the Great Osiris Temple, the Temple of Seti I, and the Ramses II Temple.</p>
		 <br><!--this creates a break, to separate things a little better-->

<h3>Site Description</h3>
<hr>
<p>What remains of the temple are the floor plans and some of the lower artworks and colorful reliefs of battle scenes and scenes of offering. The gateway that people enter through today is actually the Second Pylon. There was a Forecourt waith a First Pylon, red-granite statues and doorways, as well as a Heb-Sed Chapel but not much remains of these. There are figures and inscriptions that remain near the base of the Second Pylon. After entering through the Second Pylon, there is the Open Court. There are eighteen Osiride statues of Ramses but these are very badly preserved. The southern side of the temple is left open with stairways leading deeper into the temple. There are columns that suggest there was once a roof. On the south, east, and west sides of the Second Pylon are scence of offering. The west side also includes text that were speeches from the king.</p>
<br>
<p>The stairways lead into the portico, which contains 16 pillars that face the open court. Eight of the pillars are squared and the other eight are Osiride. On the southwest and northwest walls are images of Nubian war prisoners and Asiatic captives. The rear wall has doorways leading to four shrine chambers as well as a doorway to the next hall. In between the doorways to the chambers are stone panels of the king making offerings. Above these figures are feet which indicate that there were probably large relief images of the king. Measurements from the stone panels and these feet indicate that the back wall of the portico may have been 24 feet high. It can be suggested that the temple must have been a long rectangle with very high walls. The four chambers were dedicated to 1. Osiris and Hathor with Ramses, Seti, and Seti's barque; 2. Ramses and Seti with Osiris and Horus; 3. Ramses with Osiris, Ramses's barque, Thoth and Horus; 4. Osiris, Isis, and Horus.</p>

<br>
<p>The next room is called the First Octostyle because it has eight square pillars that supported the roof. The gateway is surrounded by black granite doorframes. On the walls there are headless gods whose names and purposes are unknown. The southwest corner contains a shrine that shows Ramses making offerings to a variety of gods. In the opposite corner are steps that would have led to the roof. There is a doorway that leads to the last large room, which is the Second Octostyle room. This room has eight pillars as well. There are nine chambers that lead into the innermost part of the temple. On the west there are three chambers that are dedicated to representations of Thebes. The three chambers on the other side are dedicated to representations of gods of Abydos. On the southwest wall, there are three cult shrine chambers dedicated to Horus, Isis, and Osiris. The one dedicated to Osiris is inaccurately named the "Alabastor Shrine" because it's made from white limestone. The western and southern outer walls are notable for their beautiful carvings of the Battle of Kadesh hymn.</p>
<br>
<h3>Excavations and Significance</h3>
<hr>
<p>The British Museum holds a Kings List that was found in 1837 in one of the shrine chambers off the portico. The list was discovered by WJ Bankes. The list is incomplete but the names are similar to those on the kings list from the Seti I temple. Auguste Mariette excavated the site in 1869 and published a report in 1880. Mariette correctly dated the site to the 19th Dynasty. Flinders Petrie conducted an excavation in 1902. Both Mariette and Petrie created a floor plan but both were inaccurate. Petrie thought the temple to be a gateway to the cemetary. David O'Connor excavated in 1967 with the Pennsylvania-Yale expedition. The expedition resulted in an accurate and detailed floor plan, as well as thorough translations of inscriptions. O'Connor also identified the structure as a temple.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<hr>
<p>In conclusion, I think the Ramses II temple is significant for its colorful reliefs and depictions of battles and offerings. Despite being mostly in ruins, it holds significant information about Ramses, Seti, and the worship of Osiris. The discovery of the kings list is significant to piece together points of history and fill in gaps.</p>
