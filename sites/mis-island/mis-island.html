         <h3>Introduction</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
		 <p>Christianity first came to Egypt around 33 CE, and was not greatly opposed by Egyptian religious and political rulers. Because of this, it was able to spread to the far reaches of the land. Mis Island was
       a medieval settlement, inhabited by Christians and located in northern Nubia within the fourth cataract of the Nile River. Four cemeteries, a church, and a settlement existed on the island. By exhuming
       a large sample of the graves, and examining grave goods and bodies, archaeological evidence has been able to indicate how burial practices of the Christian faith merged with pre-existing Egyptian ones. </p>

</figure>
Mis Island is located between Karima and Abu Hamad within the Nile River’s fourth cataract in modern day Sudan. In Winston Churchill’s 1899 book The River War, he wrote the following about the fourth cataract
   and the surrounding Monassir Desert: </p>
   <p><q>Throughout the whole length of the course of the Nile there is no more miserable wilderness than the Monassir Desert. The stream of the river is broken and its channel
   obstructed by a great confusion of boulders, between and among which the water rushes in dangerous cataracts. The sandy waste approaches the very brim, and only a few palm-trees, or here and there a squalid
   mud hamlet, reveal the existence of life</q></p>

 <h3>Description of Site</h3>
<hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
<p>The site at Mis Island contains four cemeteries, a church structure, and a settlement.
  From 2005 – 2007, 627 bodies were exhumed from three of the cemeteries. One cemetery, 3-J-18, was associated with a church. The smallest, 3-J-20, was located on a hill at the southern edge of the settlement. </p>

<figcaption>Image 2 - Burial with three rocks placed to protect head</figcaption>

</figure>In cemetery 3-J-10, the deceased were buried in one of two ways: on either side or on their backs in a grave with no structural elaboration, or on their backs with a sub-square rock on either side of the head
  and a flat rock laid over their face. These burials were used at almost the same rate. The monuments for buried adults at 3-J-10 consisted of sub-angular rocks set in a rectangle, with rocks arranged to form
  flat external faces. These often survived to be four courses in height with
  interiors of smaller rocks and gravel. Monuments for children were different: rocks formed a sort of irregular pavement over the graves, with small rocks forming an oval or sub-rectangle with gravel inside. </p>
<p>Both burial methods used at cemetery 3-J-10 were used at 3-J-11. The latter also saw bodies laid on their backs with large flat stones placed on ledges within the graves to create a chamber around the body that
  was free of earth. This type of burial was very uncommon, with only about seven percent of the 283 bodies exhumed being buried in this way. In contrast, around forty percent were buried with no structural
  elaboration. Graves with blocking stones were often disturbed by later burials of different types. Since the reverse is not true, it can be inferred that the blocking stone burials occurred earlier. Many graves
  were found with ceramic vessels. Most were cups or large spherical vessels placed at the feet of the deceased. Many of the graves with vessels had been disturbed, suggesting this, too, was an early burial
  practice. A fair amount of monuments
  in this cemetery consisted of large stone slabs laid along the width of the graves, forming a pavement. The remains in both of these cemeteries suggested a high mortality rate for infants and small children. </p>

<figcaption>Image 3 - Remains of necklace and cross pendant from 3-J-18</figcaption>

</figure>The church cemetery, 3-J-18, was likely in use at the same time as the others, allowing for a choice as to where to bury the deceased. The church cemetery could have been used for the more high-status burials,
  and therefore would not have included many children. The monuments in this cemetery were made of stone, mud brick, fired brick, or a combination of the three. The fired brick monuments were made of a rectangle
  of bricks along the outer faces of the grave. They were mostly laid flat, but some were set on their edges. Natural sand and silt were the most common interior of these monuments. Some had mud brick or more
  fired brick. There was evidence of lime rendering in places. The mud brick monuments had a line one – three bricks thick running along the center length of the grave, with bricks running off at right angles on
  either side. No lime was found, but the positioning suggests that lime rendering did occur. Preservation was much better in this cemetery. Several bodies were found with soft tissues and textiles. The deceased
  were preserved by being wrapped in woven cloth tied by lengths of string. While no
  ceramics were found in these graves, there were many graves uncovered with jewelry, including rings, bracelets, and earrings made of metal, and beads from necklaces. Two graves had necklaces with metal crosses.
  </p>
<p>The final cemetery, 3-J-20, had only five inhumations, and all had been robbed. There were
  four fired brick monuments, and one rectangular stone structure flanked by a line of fired brick. The structure resembles a sort of mausoleum, and suggests that this cemetery was an exclusive place for burials.</p>

<figcaption>Image 4 - Stone foundations found at 3-J-20</figcaption>

</figure>A large area strewn with irregular stones made up the settlement, 3-J-19. There were occasional depressions with fewer stones, signifying the interior of buildings. Three ten by ten meter squares were excavated,
   with two containing an assortment of sub-circular and sub-square remains of the stone foundations of buildings. The poor quality and low height of the walls made it difficult to determine the function of any
   buildings. Some foundations that managed to survive were found running under the stones of later foundations. The height of the surviving walls suggests that builders took and reused materials from older
   structures in new ones. The third ten by ten meter square revealed a series of channels in the ground. They ran in parallel lines, from north to south and east to west, and were most likely created by small
   stakes driven into the ground for a fence or temporary wall. Also discovered in the third square were fourteen post holes. Some may have supported roofs
  over animal pens, while others could have been arranged to form a rough circle. Within the settlement were areas of baked earth, likely caused by fires, which had no found association with any structures. </p>
<p>While most of the activity at Mis Island occurred during the medieval period, there was evidence suggesting at least two burials at 3-J-11 from the Meroitic period. A subterranean chamber with many grave
  goods was discovered, as well as a cache of other goods. No remains were found, and archaeologists believe the graves were robbed.</p>

<h3>Significance of Excavations</h3>
<hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
<p>The remains of the church, coupled with the crosses found in some graves, is significant evidence that the island was inhabited by people of the Christian faith. Despite this, the burial and monument types
   are very reminiscent of traditional Egyptian burials, in which pyramid-like mounds are built over the graves. </p>
<p>Study of the exhumed remains indicates that many physical injuries occurred. There was evidence of broken bones – both healed and fresh – on many of the skeletal remains. There were cracks on skulls that were
  possibly the cause of death for those
  individuals.  While it is impossible to determine whether these injuries were the result of accident or violence, it is still an interesting and significant insight into the lives of those who lived there. </p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
<p>Mis Island was an area settled by Christians in medieval times. They built a church, as well as a collection of other, unknown buildings, and made use of several cemeteries. The Christian practices mixed with
   pre-existing Egyptian ones to result in a unique way of burying and honoring the deceased.</p>
