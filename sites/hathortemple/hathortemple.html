    <h3>Introduction</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
      <p>The Temple of Hathor (formerly Temple of Tentyra) falls within the Dendera Temple complex just a short travel
        from modern Qena, Egypt. It was constructed in dedication to the Ancient Egyptian Goddess Hathor; the goddess of
        motherhood, joy, and feminimity. While the standing structure as it is today was not built until the Late
        Plotematic period, the site itself dates back to the Middle Kingdom. Since the temple's construction it has seen
        numerous renovations and changes as leadership within Ancient Egypt changed. Throughout its excavation there has
        been multiple findings that have had made major impacts on our current thinking of Ancient Egyptian culture,
        religion, and society.</p>

    <h3>Regional and Geographic Setting</h3>
     <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
      <p>The Temple of Hathor is in Upper Egypt approximately 7.7 kilometers southwest and across the Nile from Qena.
        The temple is between the 4th and 5th cataracts of the Nile River. It is just on the edge of the Nile Valley
        next to the Western Desert, near the mouth of the Wadi Hammamat route which opens to the Red Sea (Kipfer, 153).
        The area had plentiful sandstone as well as materials for mudbrick as indicated by the construction of the temple.
        While most temples in Ancient Egypt face towards the Nile, the Temple of Hathor faces to the north due to the bend
        of the Nile (Blackwell, 325).</p>
     <br>
    <h3>Site Description</h3>
     <hr>
      <p>According to Bard in “Encyclopedia of the Archaeology of Ancient Egypt”, the Dendera Temple complex is enclosed
        by a mud-brick wall with cemeteries surrounding it. In the center of the complex is the Temple of Hathor. The
        temple itself is also surrounded by a mud brick wall, emphasizing the sanctity of the area. The plan of the
        temple has a sanctuary, chapels, and liturgical halls that would be used to store offerings and equipment used in
        daily rituals (Bard,353). Alongside the temple’s liturgical halls are cult rooms (Bard, 353).  Bard writes that
        underneath the temple are underground crypts that served as a foundation. On each side of the temple is a
        staircase leading to the roof which contains six chapels dedicated to the cult of Osiris (Bard, 353). Outside of
        the temple are birthing constructs called mammisi, created in devotion to the birth of Hathor’s child, Harsomtous
        (Bard, 353). Just outside the temple is also a sacred lake with a bark chapel beside it (Bard, 353).</p>

  <h3>Excavation and Results</h3>
    <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
      <p>During the 19th century Flinders Petrie, an English Egyptologist, surveyed the temple. Since then numerous
        excavations of the site have been made resulting in various findings. One noteworthy example is the 160 statues
        found within the underground crypts, the oldest being made of wood and nearly inaccessible (Bard, 353). While a
        variety of artifacts and reliefs have been uncovered, two major ones have impacted current thoughts on Ancient
        Egypt. These finds are the Dendera Light and the Dendera Zodiac. </p>
      <br><!--this creates a break, to separate things a little better-->
      <p><b>Dendera Light </b><p>
      <p>The Dendera Light has been a source of controversy and tension amongst scholars and theorists. Within the
        Temple of Hathor are three stone reliefs that shows various people standing and sitting around what arguably
        looks like a light bulb. The image shows a lotus, and from that lotus a bubble—or “bulb”—emerges with a snake
        (the filament) at the center. At one end of the bubble is a Djed (a coil looking structure with two arms
        stretching from the top) supporting it. It has been argued by many people that this is evidence of electricity
        in Ancient Egypt. One person by the name of Van Daniken even went as far to make a working model of it. Paul
        Darin, author of “Ancient Egypt Illuminated by Electricity?” writes that Daniken’s working model uses two metal
        beams that look like stretched out arms, a wire to connect those beams with the lotus socket, and that the light
        emits an eerie purplish glow.</p>

       Light Bulb"</figcaption> </figure>
       <br><!--this creates a break, to separate things a little better-->
      <p>When arguing for the existence of a working light within Ancient Egypt the source of electricity must also
        be theorized. Darin writes that proponents of the Egyptian electricity hypothesis claim that the Great Pyramid
        of Giza was in-fact a power plant. One man by the name of Christopher Dunn argued that inside the Great Pyramid
        was a power-generating apparatus made primarily of pink granite, a material rich in microquartz crystals which
        can generate electricity under pressure (Darin). This belief—that Ancient Egyptians had electricity or that the
        Great Pyramid is a powerhouse—has been widely rejected by academic scholars. Rather, Egyptologists and
        Archaeologists have looked to Ancient Egyptian religion and theology to explain the Dendera Light.</p>
       <p>In Vernon Macondald’s book “Ancient Aliens Exposed: Debunking UFO’s, Ancient Astronauts and Other Unexplained
         Mysteries”, he writes that in Ancient Egyptian origin mythology there was first nothingness and from that
         emerged a lotus flower. From that flower came a bubble of air and within it is a snake. That bubble then
        led to the creation of the universe. Another author, Matthew Delooze who wrote “The Stars are Falling –
         Reasons to Believe We Are Enslaved By The Serpent”, says that the Djed which supports the bubble symbolizes
         stability for life.  Madondald points out that if the technology actually did exist it is unlikely that it would
         not be seen anywhere else due to Ancient Egypt’s high amount of interaction with foreign nation-states.</p>
       <br><!--this creates a break, to separate things a little better-->
       <p><b>Dendera Zodiac</b><p>
       <p>The Dendera Zodiac was removed from the Temple of Hathor in 1821 by Napolean Bonaparte’s team and is now
         located in the Louvre Museum. It was found within the temple’s roof—an area devoted to the god Osiris—and has
         been dated back to approximately 50 B.C. (Hussein; Buchwald and Josefowicz, 418). The zodiac depicts Egyptian
         constellations plus twelve zodiacal signs, and a border with 36 decans which represent Egyptian weeks in a
         year (Buchwald and Josefowicz, 418). The finding of this particular zodiac was shocking because of its
         inconsistency with other zodiacs found in Ancient Egypt. Often Ancient Egyptian reliefs would depict objects
         and/or concepts in a linear fashion, making the Dendera Zodiac a unique outlier. In the past, this was
         attributed to Roman influence during the time period of its creation. This theory was developed because the
         names of four Roman emperors who ruled Egypt was carved into the zodiac. Thus, the Dendera Zodiac was dated
         to the Roman era but its true date was later determined though analysis of the constellations and references
         to eclipses. Therefore, the Roman names were added after the zodiac’s completion (Hussein).</P>

        <p>Hussein writes that during the time of the zodiac’s creation (the Ptolemaic era) Egypt was ruled by kings
          of Greek descent. This means that Ancient Egyptian culture was experiencing change and influence because of
          foreign leadership. Rather than viewing the Dendera Zodiac as a uniquely Ancient Egyptian work, it is
          actually the combination of Greek and Egyptian artistic styles and concepts (Hussein). </p>

  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
      <p>The Temple of Hathor to this day is one of the most well-preserved temples in Egypt. Findings at the site have
        had critical impacts on ways of thinking regarding Ancient Egyptian culture, beliefs, and history. Through the
        discovery of the Dendera Light a deeper understanding for Ancient Egyptian theology and origin beliefs have
        developed. Because origin mythology is a center-piece to that culture which is exemplified in mortuary
        practices and complexes the Dendera Light has become an important part of any excavation in that region of the
        world. While it is still a debated finding, it has provided context to Ancient Egyptian theology in the
        scholarly community. Even though many Egyptologists and Archaeologists reject the Egyptian Electricity theory,
        it has given archaeological finds from Egypt a spotlight in western cultures, rejuvenating a passion for
        Ancient Egypt amongst crowds that had otherwise lost interest.</p>
      <p>The Dendera Zodiac has also been critical to shaping our understanding of Ancient Egypt. Through the discovery
        of its creation date context to the political and cultural environment at that time and later on has been
        established as well as solidified. The way in which the artifact combines Egyptian and Greek concepts and art
        signifies a change in Ancient Egyptian frameworks. By incorporating a foreign culture into their own, especially
        in a temple context, it shows Egyptians may have welcomed that change. The addition of Roman names later on
        indicates an establishment of power, and that Roman control of Egypt was not easily gained.</p>
      <p>The findings of the Temple of Hathor continue to play an important role in Egyptian Archaeology.
        It has withstood remarkable changes in political environment throughout history and is a standing testament to
        that.</p>
