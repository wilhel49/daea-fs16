		  <p>The site of Naga ed-Deir, “Village of the Monastery”, is a necropolis consisting of a series of ancient cemeteries. The necropolis was used intermittently from the Predynastic Period through Coptic times. The burials excavated from the cemeteries at this sight represents a large sample of an ancient population that can provide many insights into the lives of the Ancient Egyptians. </p>

         <h3>Introduction to Location, Geography and Setting</h3>
         <hr>
         <p>Naga ed-Deir lies on the east bank of the Nile River in Upper Egypt and is located about 28 kilometers downriver of Abydos. An eponymous modern village, a Coptic monastery and the tomb of Sheikh Farag, a local Islamic holy man, coincide with the cemeteries here. The necropolis extends from the modern village and Coptic monastery in the south to just north of the tomb of Sheikh Farag, a length of approximately 2 kilometers. The local topography is comprised of alluvial slopes and gebel (limestone cliffs). The site is divided into three sections by three large wadis (ravines). The necropolis had been in use from the early Predynastic Period through Coptic times, although not consistently. The tombs originally had dated between the Predynastic Period and Middle Kingdom but were also reused during the Second Intermediate Period, New Kingdom, Greco-Roman and later Coptic Periods. The necropolis is associated with the ancient town of Tny (also called This/Thinis, Tin, or Tjeni) located on the west bank of the Nile River. Tny used this necropolis as early as the Old Kingdom. The association was made because of the inscriptions on the dynastic era tombs. Tny was the capital of the eighth Upper Egyptian nome, TW-wr. The exact location of Tny is unknown, although it has been associated with the modern sites of Girga, el-Birba and Naga at-Tina. </p>

         <h3>Description of the Site</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>Naga ed-Deir is a necropolis consisting of thousands of burials in a series of cemeteries sloping from the gebel to the Nile riverbank. The cememteries are spread throughout the alluvial slopes, as well as cut into the hills and ravines of the area. The Sheikh Farag tomb marks the northern edge of the site and the modern village of Naga ed-Deir creates the southern boundary. The site consists of a variety of tomb types, including rock cut tombs, decorated wall tombs and burial pits. There are tombs with more than one chamber, wooden roofs, corbel vaults and stairways. The site had been badly looted in the years prior to the initial excavation in 1901. Many tombs were also damaged by denudation and flooding from the Nile River prior to initial excavations. A depression located south of the Sheikh Farag promontory contains shaft graves and mud-brick mastabas built during the eighth through the twelfth dynasties. More cemeteries are located on the alluvial slopes from the ravines as well as cut into the stone of the hills. One cemetery used during the second and third dynasty was buried by debris and its own superstructures in ancient times and then covered by another cemetery during the sixth and seventh dynasty. The cemeteries were numbered based on location. Cemeteries 100 through 3500 are at the southern portion of the site, located between the three ravines. The cemeteries towards the north side of the site are numbered 9000 to 10000.</p>

         <h3>Discussion of Excavations</h3>
         <hr>
         <p>Naga ed-Deir was excavated intermittently between 1901 and 1924. American Egyptologist George A. Riesner and his team, Albert Lythgoe, Arthur C. Mace, and Frederick W. Green, initially excavated the site in the early 1900s as part of the Phoebe A. Hearst Egyptian Expedition of the University of California. Riesner later returned to the site to lead the Joint Harvard University/Museum of Fine Arts, Boston Expedition working with Alan Rowe, Clarence S. Fisher, and Dows Dunham.  The Hearst Egyptian Expedition excavated the site from 1901 to 1904 and the Harvard/Boston Expedition took over in 1910. Naga ed-Deir was a site of particular interest since it represented a sequence of development lasting almost six thousand years. The preservation of the site was in danger during the time before excavations began due to looting and flooding. Mud brick was also being excavated by the sebakhin from the site to use as fuel due to the organic matter in it. The well-preserved skeletal materials in the tombs at this site were also of particular interest since they could be used to analyze race, which was a popular topic of that time. Reisner was an unusual scholar for the time, however, and disliked the common practice of the day that cherry-picked museum quality material. Reisner believed that the past could only be completely understood through analyzing the entire body of archaeological evidence including the ordinary or unremarkable finds. Reisner trained local Egyptian workman to help with record keeping and archaeological photographs. Reisner wanted systematic mapping and excavation of the cemeteries in order to determine chronological accession of the tombs and preserve context of the burials. Tomb cards were created that had a sketch of the tomb plans and recorded information about that tomb. An object logbook, a journal with daily entries and field notes were also all recorded from the excavations. Unfortunately, many of the meticulous field diaries and tomb cards from the expedition have gone missing. Much of the information from these Naga ed-Deir excavations still remains unpublished. The site has not been extensively excavated since the two expeditions led by Reinser. Archaeologists have briefly visited the site for documentation purposes, however, and still utilize and work on the Naga ed-Deir material from the two expeditions performed in the first half of the 20th century. The site is currently affected by local population growth and development.</p>

         <h3>Results and Significance of Excavations</h3>
         <hr>
         <p>The excavations at Naga ed-Deir carried out by Riesner and his team uncovered a wealth of material culture along with exceptionally well-preserved human remains. During the 1902 and 1903 field seasons, 635 numbered tombs were excavated from the Predynastic (c.3800-3200 BCE) cemetery N7000. This cemetery had incredible preservation of perishable material; clothing, wood, basketry and even human hair, skin and internal organs were all recovered during excavations. Anatomist Grafton Elliot Smith was able to analyze Predynastic bodies that included skin and internal organs due to the good preservation. He found some evidence of male circumcision but none for the practice of clitordectomy.  There also were remains excavated that dated to the Early Dynastic period (c.3050–2700 BCE). Cultural material associated with these remains included large flint knives, metal tools and weapons, cylinder seals, and gold jewelry. Some remains excavated from cemeteries 500-900 dating to the Old Kingdom (c.2687–2206 BCE) were located in mud-brick mastaba tombs, which included a mud-brick beehive tomb similar to those found in cemeteries near the Giza Pyramids. Ordinary tombs were also found in these cemeteries.  The late Old Kingdom/First Intermediate Period cemetery 3500, as well as others from this period, became well known for the discovery of a large series of painted limestone stelae. The stelae acted as gravestones that represented female and male local dignitaries of the time. Although largely unpublished, material culture was found with remains dating to periods after the First Intermediate Period. Middle Kingdom (c.2687–2206 BCE) cemeteries 400, 1500, and 200 had coffins, jewelry, stone vessels, ceramics, and funerary masks. Tomb models were found ranging from the Late Old Kingdom to the Late Middle Kingdom and illustrated common scenes of daily life during this time period. This included models representing brick and bread making as well as models related to beer production and consumption. Burials from the Second Intermediate Period (1700-1570 BCE) and the New Kingdom (1570-1070 BCE) were less common than the earlier periods but still produced material culture such as pottery, coffins, furniture, scribal palettes, and un-inscribed funerary cones. The Third Intermediate Period, the Late Period and the Greco-Roman Period burials were rare at this site and were scattered throughout the site rather than grouped together. They were found in association with ceramics for the most part. There were also a large number of Coptic burials at the site, some dating into more recent times highlighting the changing customs of local Christian burials. The excavations done at Naga ed-Deir represent a large sample of an ancient population that is rarely found in the archaeological record. The burials also span the entirety of Ancient Egyptian timeline, which provides a unique look into the burial practices through the dynasties.</p>

         <h3>Conclusion</h3>
         <hr>
         <p>The site of Naga ed-Deir is important because of the insight it provides into Ancient Egypt. The amount of material culture, burial practice and health statistics about the Ancient Egyptians available at this sight is rarely found in the archaeological record. The necropolis’ association with the capital of the 8th nome, Tyn, provides insight into the political afterlife. The abundance of material culture spanning six thousand years provides insight into the changing mortuary practices of Ancient Egypt. The well preserved remains analyzed by bioarchaeologists or could provide information about the health of the people who lived there. The excavations led by George A. Reisner were also very important for the field of archaeology. Reisner was a pioneer in archaeology for his use of photography. Over seven thousand photographs of the excavations were taken. The quality of documentation done by Reisner and his team was rarely found this early in the 20th century. This also enables anthropologists and Egyptologists to study the site of Naga ed-Deir through the documentation over a century later.</p>
