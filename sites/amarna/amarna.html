		 <p> The site of Amarna, also referred to as Tell el-Amarna, is the ruins and tombs of the city Akhetaton (“horizon of Aten”), which  was built around 1348 BCE. It was built during the 18th dynasty by the Pharaoh Akhenaton (Amenhotep IV). During Pharaoh Akhenaten’s rule, sometimes referred to as the Amarna period, Tell el-Amarna was built as the new capital of the Egyptian empire. The capital was built after Akhenaten abandoned the traditional polytheistic gods and religion of ancient Egypt and devoted himself to the worship of the sun disk Aten.  Akhetaton was only the capital of Ancient Egypt during the pharaoh Akhenaten’s reign (ca. 1353-1336 BCE) and was abandoned shortly after his death.  </p>

		<h3>Geographic and Regional Setting</h3>
			<hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
		 <p>The city of Amarna is on the eastern bank of the Nile, near the border of Middle and Upper Egypt, and about half way between the ancient cities of Thebes and Memphis. The city expands over an area of approximately thirteen kilometers (Peet and Woolley 1923 p1) . Its sandy terrain is capped on the east side by large limestone cliffs, which are broken up into wadis (Arabic word for valleys) that recede into the Nile river. Many large stelae are present in the wadis that surround the city, which tell the history of the city and its significance to the pharaoh Akhenaten. </p>
		 
<br><!--this creates a break, to separate things a little better-->
    	
		<h3>Site Description</h3>
 	   		<hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each 			section heading in the example-->	
	   <p>The site of Amarna consists of several different sections. The main sections include: the central city, the main city and its southern suburbs, the north city and its suburbs, and the Workmen’s Village (also referred to as the Eastern Village).</p>

	 <figcaption><a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" 	data-content="Dominic Montserrat, Akhenaten: History, Fantasy and Ancient 	Egypt. London:Routledge, 55-94.;"> Image 3</a> - "Plan of the Central 	City at Amarna"</figcaption>
	 </figure>
	
	
	<p> The main entry way into the central part of the city is through the “Royal Road” or the “King’s Way”. The road runs roughly north to south, and passes through the Royal Palace, the Royal Houses, and the King’s Houses. At one point, evidence leads archaeologists to believe that a bridge once connected the Royal Palace and the King’s House. To the north of the road is the Great Temple of Aten where ceremonies and offering were made to the sun god Aten. To the east of the King’s House was where the Records Office presided, which was the site where the Amarna Letters were discovered in 1887 by local Egyptians. To the south of the King’s House lies the Small Temple of Aten. </p>
		<p>The main city and southern suburbs lie to the south of the central city and mostly contained housing structures. The houses of notable people during the Amarna period resided here such as the sculptor Thutmose and the chief chariot officer Ranefer. Some of the larger houses in this area had the name of the owner carved on the doorframes, but few of these houses have been uncovered. Some of the other structures in this area were used for storage. The southern suburb is a continuation of the main city and contains larger houses and estates, including that of the vizier Nakht. The southern suburbs weren’t built as well as houses in the main city, which leads archaeologists to believe that they were probably occupied for a shorter period of time than their main city counterparts (Kemp 2012 p 162). </p>

<p>The north city and suburbs lay between the base of the cliffs to the east and the Nile river to the west. It also is the area that contains the North River Palace, which is marked by a double brick wall. This palace is thought to be the main residence of the royal family (Amarna Project 2010). Large houses and structures are also present here including the North Administrative Building. The north suburbs are usually divided into two sections by archaeologists due to a wadi cutting through the area. The houses in the north suburbs range in size and in proximity to each other. 
<br>
<br>
	
The Workmen’s Village is located to the east of the main city and is isolated from the rest of the site. It contains six main parts: a walled village, the zir area, site X1, animal pens, chapels, and also pits and trash deposits. The walled village contained about seventy-two houses of similar size and shape, they also contained evidence of crafting materials. This was most likely where the tomb workers resided. Large pottery jars found in the zir area lead archaeologists to believe that it was possibly used as a water storage place. Site  X1 consists of a possible boundary marker, such as a wall, and also has evidence of smaller rooms and a terrace. Animal pens were found that were circular in structure, made of brick. Some of these pens also contained pig bones. The Chapels were small in structure and also made of brick, they were used as memorial spaces to pay tribute to ancestors (Amarna Project).

		<h3>Archaeological Excavations and Results- Past and Present</h3>
 	   		<hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each 			section heading in the example-->	
	   <p>The site of Amarna has been intensely excavated for over a century. Site excavations began during the nineteenth century when Sir John Gardner Wilkinson mapped the city remains. Sir William Flinders Petrie was also present during the initial archaeological excavations in the 1890s. Petrie was responsible for the initial excavations at the Great Temple of Aten, which lies towards the middle of the site, as well as the painted pavements of the Royal Palace.  Excavations of the site revealed that the more important buildings and temples were built of stone, especially for their thresholds and framework, but the houses were built mostly of an unbaked sun-dried mud brick material. Wood was used very rarely, mostly for columns, roofing and staircase supports. 
<br>
<br>
In 1921 and 1922 the Workmen’s village was partially excavated by Egyptian Exploration Society archaeologists T.E. Peet and  C. Leonard Woolley. This area was later resurveyed by Barry Kemp from 1979 to 1986 (Amarna Project). Since the Workmen’s village is a distance away from the Central and Main cities, structural preservations are under better conditions and a  “complete archaeological print of human community is preserved on the desert” (Amarna Project).  
<br>
<br>
Excavations of the site were continued, with little interruption, until the late 1930s. At this time most of the royal buildings and some of the residential areas had been excavated. The Royal Palace underwent excavation in the 1930s by the Egyptian Exploration Society under J.D.S. Pendlebury. In the late 1970s, excavations by the Egyptian Exploration Society were taken over by archaeologist Barry Kemp who is still in charge of the project, which is now overseen by the Amarna Trust.

	 </figure>
	 
Excavations of the Main city during the early 20th century have revealed that it was connected to the Central city by three large roads. These roads could have been developed as the city grew or may have been used as a continuation of the Royal Road (Amarna Project). The known houses of the main city vary in their sizing and placement but are for the most part poorly preserved, only the outline can be seen for some of the larger ones. In 2000 the Egypt Exploration society reexamined the house of Ranefer, the chief chariot officer, as well as the surrounding areas. The evidence revealed houses of different sizes surrounding Ranefer’s (Amarna Project). Excavations of the Main city have also revealed that there were large scale storage units near the Nile River in order to accommodate the massive amount of trade goods imported. 

<br>
<br>
In the Southern Suburbs small amounts of the area have been excavated. Parts of the area are unable to undergo excavation due to them having been encroached on by a modern day cemetery associated with the modern village of el-Hagg Qandil.
<br>
<br>
Although a greater portion of the North City remains unexcavated by archaeologists, the area’s surface shows that it has been looted in the past by people looking for artifacts from the Amarna period. The North city’s excavations revealed many fragments of painted mud plaster, which were found in the architectural remains near the wadi that separates the two sections of the city. The excavator, John Pendlebury, believed “that they had fallen from a room over the top of the gateway that had possessed a window where the king could appear to the outside world” (Amarna Project).
<br>
<br>
The North suburb was completely excavated between 1926 and 1932 by the Egypt Exploration Society. Excavations revealed that the houses that resided closer to the Nile river were occupied for longer than those that were further back. A few of the houses that were further away from the river show evidence of not being finished. Because of this, “the eastern part of the North Suburb was therefore in the process of being extended by newly arrived inhabitants at the time that the city was abandoned” (Amarna Project).

		<h3>Conclusion</h3>
 	   		<hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each 			section heading in the example-->	
	   <p>The city of Akhetaton (the site of Amarna) was built as the new capital during the reign of the Pharaoh Akhenaton (Amenhotep IV) and offers insight into the Amarna Period’s history and culture. During the Amarna Period, Akhenaten abandoned the traditional polytheistic gods and religion of ancient Egypt and devoted himself to the worship of the sun disk Aten.  Since Amarna was only occupied during Akhenaten’s reign and for a short period after, it is the only site from ancient Egypt that preserves the archaeological evidence of urban lifestyle across a full social, cultural, and environmental range. The fact that the structures in the city and surrounding areas were poorly built conveys the idea that the site was not made with the intentions of lasting long. Excavations of this site allow archaeologists insight into a key period during ancient Egyptian history. </p>
