         <h3>Introduction</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
		 <p>Deir el-Bahri is located in Egypt on the West side of the Nile, across from Luxor, near the entrance to the Valley of the Kings. It is home to three ancient temples, including the mortuary temple of Hatshepsut. Two of these temples were built on top of parts of the first one. Many years after the temples were built, the area became a necropolis for Egyptians in the Roman Period. This site was used from the First Intermediate Period all the way through the Roman Period.</p>
		 <br><!--this creates a break, to separate things a little better-->

		 <h3>Location, Geography, Geology, and Setting</h3>
		 <hr>
		 <p>Located near the entrance to the Valley of the Kings, Deir el-Bahri is an area almost surrounded by hills. This area has been used as the site of three temples dating back to the First Intermediate Period. One of these temples, the mortuary temple of Hatshepsut, can still be seen and visited today. The surrounding hills held the cache of mummies from the Valley of the Kings, as well as a few other tombs. Deir el-Bahri was used as a burial site for over 2,000 years.<p>
		 <br>
		 <h3>Site Description</h3>

		 <figure style="Float:left; width: 25%; Padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 5px;">

			<figcaption> Statues in the Temple of Hatshepsut</figcaption>

		 <p>This site was first used in the First Intermediate Period by Mentuhotpe as a temple and burial location for his wife, Nefru. Mentuhotpe built his temple around 2,000 B.C. Just over 500 years later, Hatshepsut built her mortuary temple over a portion of the ruins of Mentuhotpe’s temple. The purpose of her temple was to prove that she had the divine right to be Pharaoh.  She had her temple filled with paintings and stories to show what exactly gave her the right to proclaim herself king and not have to give the crown over to her son, Thutmosis III. After her death, Thutmosis III had every picture, statue, and mention of Hatshepsut on her temple destroyed. He then changed these to Thutmosis II for his father. Thutmosis III then had a smaller temple built in the same area. His temple may have been smaller but it was built to a much grander scale. However, he already had a mortuary temple built so it has been theorized that this temple was built to make Hatshepsut’s temple seem less spectacular.  <p>
		<p>Years after these temples were built, Deir el-Bahri became a necropolis used by the Egyptians in the Roman Period. It also has some Roman burials on the edge of the site. Some of these burials were simply dug holes in the ground. Others were bodies placed in already formed tombs. Some were even just placed in the temples under moundsof dirt and stone. </p>
		 <h3>Excavations</h3>
		 <hr>
		 <figure style="Float:left; width: 25%; Padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 5px;">

			<figcaption> The statue of Amun that Lord Dufferin found</figcaption>
			</figure>
		 <p>An excavation of Mentuhotpe’s mortuary temple lead by Lord Dufferin began in March 1859. They discovered a tomb with an alter too heavy to move on April 9th, 1859. This tomb later became known as Lord Dufferin’s tomb. Shortly after, the excavation was halted due to disagreements with another excavation. Instead of stopping, Lord Dufferin encouraged his crew to continue working. During this time, they uncovered a limestone statue of Amun near a wooden alter from the seventeenth dynasty and part of a statue of Mentuhotpe made of sandstone. These were remove for safekeeping until Lord Dufferin could dig again so it is not quite known exactly where in the temple they were originally found. The team found a tomb with the coffin of Queen Tem. The coffin was made of alabaster and limestone and it had broken into five pieces. This was left as it was also deemed too heavy to move. The excavation also turned up numerous unfinished tombs and alters.<p>
		 <p>The first major excavation of Hatshepsut’s mortuary temple stared on February 7, 1893 by the Egyptian Exploration Fund under Naville. This excavation uncovered most of this temple. They found many burials in the temple ranging from the Late Period to the Roman Period. Included in these burials were a number of mummy masks from the Roman Period. After the excavations, a team lead by Howard Carter reconstructed parts of the temple. </p>
		 <p>The second main excavation started in 1921. This excavation continued where Naville’s left off. During this excavation, H.E. Winlock and his crew discovered that Hatshepsut’s temple was built on the ruins of Mentuhotpe’s temple. They also found out that the layout for both temples was nearly identical. Hatshepsut’s temple appears to have started smaller but was increased at some time. Sen-Mut built Hatshepsut’s temple. He chose to make the temple a series of courts and porches rather than the traditional mortuary pyramid.  It was also determined that Sen-Mut had begun building his own tomb in Deir el-Bahri in such a way that it ended up underneath Hatshepsut’s temple, but he never finished it. Sen-Mut also put a portrait of himself on the back of every door in the temple. </p>
		 <p>This excavation uncovered pieces of at least 80 different statues. Many of them were destroyed after Thutmosis III decided to attempt to wipe out the memory of Hatshepsut. Obviously, his attempts failed. The archaeologists found more than 24 statues that stood approximately 18 feet tall. One of the pieces of these was a giant, well-preserved head. Many of the pieces of the statues were found in a nearby quarry where Thutmosisi III’s people threw the statues after destroying them. H.E. Winlock and crew also found the remains of two statues that stood about 26 feet high. They reconstructed one of them only to find some of the pieces were missing. After discovering this, the crew realized that the missing pieces were in other collections around the world. Many of them were in Berlin. When the collectors heard about this, most of them were willing to bring the pieces back together to complete the original statues. </P>
		 <p>In later years, there was a Polish excavation of Thutmosis III’s temple in Deir el-Bahri. The archaeologists determined that the name of this temple was Djeser-akhet. They established this based on wall reliefs and papyri they found in this and various other sites. In addition to that, the Polish noticed that this temple also had the same layout as both Hatshepsut and Mentuhotpe’s temples. Thutmosis III’s temple was much smaller than the previous two though. This is because he built it between Hatshepsut’s temple and the surrounding rocks where there was not much room for building.  To make up for the small site, Thutmosis III had the temple built with huge proportions. </p>
		 <p>The Polish ascertained that Djeser-akhet was not a mortuary temple and that it was, in fact, used to worship Amun. In the temple, they found many columns and pillars with inscriptions of Thutmosis III’s name. There were also statues of him as well as many wall inscriptions and reliefs. A shrine to Hathor, an Egyptian goddess that embodied many things including joy, dancing, and music, was also found in Djeser-akhet. </P>

		 <h3>Results and Significance</h3>
		 <hr>
		 <p>These excavations revealed many things. Looking at the disorganization from the excavation of Mentuhotpe’s temple compared to the much more organized excavations of both Hatshepsut and Thutmose III’s temples shows how archaeology evolved over time. The number of tombs that Lord Dufferin and his crew found also shows that Mentuhotpe was prepared to have several people buried in his temple. <p>
		 <p>Based on some potsherds found, one of the teams that excavated Hatshepsut’s temple were able to conclude that it was built starting around 1494 BC. They determined this based on the pictures on the sherds and Hatshepsut’s famous Punt excursion. They were also able to ascertain that the inner sanctuary of the temple was completed around 1490 BC because Hatshepsut’s daughter, Nefru-Re was alive in the paintings on the walls. Additionally, Sen-Mut’s unfinished tomb and his portraits everywhere suggest that he and Hatshepsut were close because, as a commoner, he had no right to either of these things.  </P>
		 <p>With the Roman burial masks, the masks themselves were intricate but there was not any intricate mummification done to the bodies. The earlier mummies that were found in the temples at Deir el-Bahri all went through the traditional, intricate mummification process of the Ancient Egyptians. This shows that the culture of the Egyptians changed over the approximately 1,500 years between the burials, as would be expected. This just shows how even super intricate cultures can change over time.</p>
		 <p>The Polish archaeologists figured out that Thutmosis III’s temple was built in the last decade of his reign based on papyri. They could also determine that it lasted into the Ramesside Period, nearly 200 years, based on graffiti found on the walls.</p>
		 <br>
		 <h3>Conclusions</h3>
		 <hr>
		 <p>Deir el-Bahri is a site that shows the intricate politics in Ancient Egypt. From Hatshepsut trying to justify her reign and prove that she had the divine right to rule to Thutmosis III trying to wipe her out of history. It also shows how the Ancient Egyptians strived to be remembered forever by having their stories carved into stone for everyone to see and read. The site did stray from the idea of pharaohs being buried in pyramids but kept alive the tradition of huge, ornately decorated buildings. Deir el-Bahri also demonstrates how sites that were important to the Egyptians could be reused again and again. This site has an interesting history that really captures the spirit of the Ancient Egyptian culture. <p>
