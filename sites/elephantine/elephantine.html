			<p>Elephantine Island, a part of modern-day Aswan, is located at the first cataract of the Nile. An important border town, it has archaeological sites ranging in dates from the Predynastic to the Greco-Roman period. The Naqada II period saw a protective fortress that expanded to include government and residential buildings and a step pyramid in the Old Kingdom. Temples of Satet and Khnum are located on the island, with both having numerous additions made starting in the Predynastic and New Kingdom, respectfully. Other important finds from Elephantine include a Late Period nilometer and evidence of a Jewish mercenary community during the Persian occupation. The referenced Jewish temple from this textual evidence has yet to be discovered. Elephantine was first excavated by the French in 1901. Since 1969 the site has been excavated as a long-term joint project by the German Archaeological Institute and the Swiss Institute of Architectural and Archaeological Research on Ancient Egypt. </p>

			<br>	
			<p>Elephantine’s location and natural resources made it a site of varying importance throughout the extensive history of the Egyptian empire. The first cataract’s rapids were the traditional southern boundary between Egypt and neighboring Nubia. As parts of Nubia were conquered and lost, Elephantine’s status as a border town fluctuated. Nevertheless, Elephantine flourished as trading hub connecting Egyptian, Nubian, and Sub-Saharan African trade routes.   </p>
			<br>
			<p> Geographically speaking, Elephantine Island is approximately 1500 meters by 500 meters in the present day (Snape 143). It is located near the city of Aswan with coordinates 24°05′N, 32°56′E. The oldest sites dating back to the Neolithic are mostly concentrated on the southern portion of the island. This phenomenon is due to the separation of the island by an ancient inundation flooded swamp. The southern island was considered a secluded haven of the goddess Satet. Eventually, elevation of the Nile lowered enough during the First Intermediate Period to fill in the swamp and connect the island as one land mass (Snape 143-144). Elephantine ultimately served as the capital of the first Upper Egyptian Nome (Amen 2).</p>
			<br>
			<p>In terms of natural resources, Elephantine Island is essentially solid granite. The Egyptians quarried black, gray, and red varieties of granite during ancient times and continue to do so into the present (“Elephantine” 1). The rocky ground mostly provides poor farming land, so the island could not support a large population. Elephantine’s status as a trading center allowed the settlements to obtain the resources it could not grow otherwise.   </p>
			<br>
		<h3>Site Description</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->	
			<p>Because of Elephantine’s rich and lengthy history of use, many important archaeological features of interest exist at the site. Most of the features are concentrated on the southern section of the island, with the exception of the nilometers. The two nilometers of the island are located on the eastern side of Elephantine and just south of the temple of Khnum. The eastern nilometer is newer and measures high water marks while the southern nilometer is older and measures both the flood height below a low water mark and the height of flood waters over farmable land (Jackson 115). The eastern nilometer contains inscriptions in Greek and Demotic and was heavily remodeled during the Roman occupation. The southern nilometer dates specifically to the 26th Dynasty (Amen 12).</p>

			>Image 3</a> - "Plan of Elephantine"</figcaption>

			<br>
			<p> The residential section of the island includes scattered sections of First, Second, and Third Dynasty fortresses as well as a large town enclosure wall dating to the Third Intermediate Period. There is a lot of evidence to these walls being dismantled, refortified, and moved throughout the years. Several residential districts exist on the island ranging in date from the Middle Kingdom and 18th Dynasty to the Third Intermediate and Late Periods . </p>
			<br>
			<p> Apart from the residential buildings, numerous religious sites exist on Elephantine. The main deities worshiped at the site were the triad of Khnum, Satet, and Anukis. Khnum was represented with a ram’s head or potter’s wheel and is responsible for demonstrating the annual flood of the Nile. Satet is his consort and is deemed the guardian of the southern Egyptian boundaries. Anukis is Khnum and Setet’s daughter and is keeper of the cataracts (Amen 3-5). In addition to temples honoring the triad, a dummy step period exists on the western side of the island. This pyramid dates to the third dynasty and represents “the King” as an imaginary presence (Amen 12). </p>
			<br>
			<p> The main temples at Elephantine are of Khnum and Satet. Satet’s temple was initially constructed out of a Naqada II grotto and was notably expanded in the Middle Kingdom, New Kingdom, and Ptolemaic Period. The temple was initially rebuilt by Pepi I (Amen 12). Khnum’s temple appeared in the Middle Kingdom and had reconstruction done during the Late and Greco-Roman Periods. Between the two temples, a cemetery of Khnum’s sacred rams exists dating to the Greco-Roman Period. But these Egyptian temples were not the only religious buildings at Elephantine.  </p>
			<br>
			<p> Near the Middle Kingdom residential district, there is a “chapel for the ka” of the official Heka-ib (“Elephantine” 1). The patron of Elephantine was worshipped as an intermediary long after his death, though he himself is buried at Qubbet el-Hawa. A chapel on the site was originally built during the 11th Dynasty, but was rebuilt under the reign of Senwosret I with additions made well into the 13th Dynasty.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Aramaic papyrus documents found on the island also indicate the presence of a community of Jewish soldiers, with their temple dedicated to Yahweh. The Jewish soldiers were mercenaries during the Persian occupation of Egypt during the rule of Darius II. The temple was destroyed by priest of Khnum in 410 B.C, but it was rebuilt four years later (Rosenberg 4). The actual temple is yet to be discovered, but nevertheless a feature of Elephantine worth noting.   </p>
			<br>
		<h3>Discussion and Significance of Excavations</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->	
			<p> Since 1969, the   German Archaeological Institute and the Swiss Institute of Architectural and Archaeological Research on Ancient Egypt have continually excavated and restored the site. The 36th season of excavation in 2005-2006 focused particularly on the Third Dynasty fortress walls and entirety of the residential district from the New Kingdom (Raue 4-7). The nearly three meters of debris on top of the oldest town wall indicates that it ceased to be functional in the Fifth Dynasty. The clear progression of remodeling the wall to be taller and steeper indicates a great strategic interest in Elephantine from the Egyptian government at this time.  </p>
			<br>
			<p>The New Kingdom residential site that is southwest of Heka-ib’s chapel is of special interest because it displays a nearly complete stratigraphy that is lacking from other areas at the site (Raue 7). A mansion of an official named Hori was excavated with evidence of second story and unique sanitation room. The amount of wind-blown sand indicates that the mansion, built during the Ramesside Period, was abandoned during the late 18th to 20th Dynasty. The overall ebb and flow of construction and abandonment within the residential buildings at Elephantine point to the site’s importance and functionality throughout the era. A change in Egypt’s southern border would drastically change the status of Elephantine as a strategic border town.  </p>
			<br>
			<p>As for the main temples on Elephantine, Charles Clermont, Ganneau, J. Cledat, and J.E. Gautier led expeditions from 1906-1910 that uncovered the temples of Khnum and Setet (Amen 6). The Temple of Setet complex includes a sandstone temple commissioned by Hatshepsut, with Thutmose III and limestone temple commissioned by Senwosret I. (“Elephantine” 1) These temples have been a focus of the German/Swiss reconstruction and have been restored with a majority being the original stone blocks. Later temples built by Ptolemy VI and Ptolemy VIII were built on stones with the inscriptions of earlier rulers. This would indicate the longevity of the worship of Satet even into later times.  </p>

			>Image 4</a> - "Temple of Khnum"</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<br>
			<p>The Temple of Khnum has proved to be a greater archaeological challenge. The original Middle Kingdom structure dating to Sobekhotpe III has been found in minimal pieces, with the reconstruction by Thutmose III and later Nektanebo II dwarfing it (“Elephantine” 1). There is additional evidence pointing to remodeling done even up to the reign of Alexander IV. In 1908, the same team that excavated the temple also found a cemetary of sacred rams buried between the temples of Setet and Khnum. The later dates of the Temple of Khnum indicate that Khnum entered the pantheon at Elephantine much later than Satet, but was still worshipped continuously as her consort.   </p>
			<br>
			<p>The sanctuary of Heka-ib was excavated in 1946 by Labib Habachi (“Elephantine 1). A cache of religious objects including statues, stelae, and offering tables were found within the chapel which dates to the reign of Senwosret I. Evidence points to Heka-ib being honored during the Festival of Sokar in remembrance of his profitable expeditions for Upper Egypt as a state official. 1995/96 excavations yielded earlier chapel version dating back to the 11th Dynasty. Heka-ib’s worshiped role as a mediator between gods and humans is a unique positon that indicate a non-pharaonic cults being celebrated by more than just family during the Middle Kingdom.  </p>
			<br>
			<p>One of the earliest discoveries on Elephantine was the first cache of Aramatic papyrus in 1893 by C.E Wilbour (Rosenberg 6). The papyrus is without context, as most of the later Elephantine Papyri discoveries are, because of the purchase of the texts from locals. The texts are legal and personal documents of the Jewish soldiers and priests that lived on the island. A 1967 German team found the location of the community which dates to the 27th Dynasty. In 1997 a section of superior mudbrick floor as compared to surrounding finds was identified as the Jewish Temple floor. The temple was destroyed in 410 B.C, and the reconstructed temple has not been located. Though it was destroyed by priests of Khnum, the existence of a Jewish temple indicates a certain degree of religious tolerance by the Egyptians.   </p>
			<br>
		<h3>Conclusions</h3>
		 <hr>
			<p>Overall, Elephantine is a hidden gem of Egyptian archaeology. The constant human settlement for such a long period of time gives archaeologist a rare change to study how Egyptian culture developed and evolved in Upper Egypt. Elephantine also offers a look at what sites at nearby Syene might have been like. Syene is mostly buried underneath the modern city of Aswan, so scholars do not know much about the settlement. The fortified walls at Elephantine and along the road leading to neighboring Philae give important information about the defense of Egypt at its southern border. Elephantine offers a wealth of information despite its small size and still has promise of new discoveries despite being under long-term excavation for just short of fifty years.  </p>
