         <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->

     <p>Dashur is a listed UNESCO World Heritage Archaeological site, for both the late Old Kingdom and the early Middle Kingdom periods. Located on the edge of Menshiyet City’s fertile zone, about 48km southwest of Cairo, Dashur is a royal necropolis complex with several examples of early pyramids, such as the Bent and Red Pyramids. The five pyramids present at Dashur illustrate the struggles that Pharaohs, such as Snefru, encountered while building their burial structures. The necropolis with the pyramids were intended as both symbols of a both a pharaoh’s symbol of political power and as religious pathways to the afterlife of their gods.

        <h3>REGIONAL AND GEOGRAPHIC SETTING</h3>
      <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->

      <p>The large necropolis at Dashur is located about ten kilometers southeast of Saqqarah, which is also a major necropolis.  Dashur is situated across the Nile and west of Helwan, a large modern metropolis of the greater Cairo area, in the Upper Nile Region of Egypt. The modern city of Dashur is located across the Nile from Helwan, and is part of the Fertile Crescent that encompasses the Nile Valley in this region. Historically, the Dashur necropolis was part of Knife, the  22nd Nome of  Upper Egypt. The symbol for this region is a depiction of a knife. The region of the Dashur necropolis is considered to be a desert climate, with average daily temperatures in the nineties (Fahrenheit) during much of the year.  The Dashur necropolis is clearly demarcated by the sudden change in flora; within a few yards the lush greenery gives way to only sand. The three main remaining pyramids are located from approximately 1000 to 5000 feet from the edge of the fertile areas. The profiles of the remaining pyramids are the tallest structures within the necropolis.

        <h3>SITE DESCRIPTION</h3>
      <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->

        <p>There are at least ten pyramids that have been found, ranging in condition from mostly intact to eroded to the point they are difficult to locate, within the Dashur necropolis area. The pyramids were built during two distinct periods, first in the late 3rd-early 4th dynasties, during the Old Kingdom Period (2686–2181 BC), and then much later in the 12th and 13th dynasties of the Middle Kingdom Period (2055–1650 BC).  The necropolis also includes several mastabas situated over shaft tombs, which date to the Old Kingdom period.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p><strong>I. OLD KINGDOM</strong></p>
        <p></p>
        <p>The two most prominent pyramids at Dashur are the Bent Pyramid and the Red Pyramid.  Both limestone pyramids were built during the reign of Pharaoh Sneferu (2575-2551 BC), in the Old Kingdom period.  These two pyramids represent a transition from step-sided pyramids to smooth surface pyramids. The Bent Pyramid was constructed first; it has a distinctive change in the upward angles of its four corners halfway to the apex, making the top half of the pyramid appear to bend inwards upon itself.  The height of the Bent Pyramid is 344 feet with a base measurement of  617 feet per side. There is evidence that the stone blocks used to construct the pyramid were angled in such a way as to make the structure lean inwards. While it is also apparent that the Bent Pyramid was built on a less than an ideal foundation, thus causing the center of the pyramid to sink into the ground from its own weight, other popular theories abound as to what caused the “bend.” One such proposal is that Sneferu’s builders were in a “learning curve” when designing the prototype of later smooth-sided pyramids and realized when the pyramid was half built that the vertical angle of the four corners would have added considerable time to the labor required to finish the pyramid.</p>
        <p></p>

</figure>

        <p>The Red Pyramid was constructed after Sneferu was dissatisfied with the end result of the Bent Pyramid. Named the Red Pyramid for the rusty reddish limestone blocks that comprise the exterior today, the structure is the largest pyramid within the Dashur necropolis, and is exceeded in dimension and height only by two of the Great Pyramids of Giza.  The Red pyramid originally had a white limestone smooth exterior; these white stones were removed several thousands of years later and used in buildings constructed in Cairo.  The height of the Red Pyramid is 344 feet with a base of  722 feet on each side.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p><strong>II. MIDDLE KINGDOM</strong></p>
        <p></p>
        <p>During the 12th and early 13th Dynasties, there were three known pyramids built at Dashur.  The oldest, built by Amenemhet II (1926-1887 BC), is known as the White Pyramid as its exterior was constructed of white limestone. Today, all that remains of this pyramid is the inner core, due to the dismantling of the exterior over millennia for other construction projects
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Amenemhet III (1860–1814 BC) built the Black Pyramid at Dashur.  The Black Pyramid is one of the few pyramids still standing at Dashur, though it has partially become rubble.  Built of clay and mud bricks, instead of the more common use of stone, and surrounded by limestone, the pyramid received its moniker of “black” due to its darkened decayed appearing exterior. The last known pyramid to be built in the Dashur Necropolis was constructed by Senusret III (1878-1839 BC).  Little remains of this limestone covered mud brick pyramid other than an empty granite sarcophagus.
        </p>

        <p></p>
        <p>In addition to the pyramids in the Dashur Necropolis, several mastabas are present. Of these, several have been attributed to officials of Senusret III’s reign.  Approximately thirty mastabas have been excavated; three of these have been identified as belonging to Khnumhotep, Nebit and Horkherty.

       <h3>DISCUSSION OF EXCAVATIONS</h3>
      <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
        <p><strong>PRIOR TO THE 20TH CENTURY</strong>
        </P>
        <p>From around 1887 to just before the turn of the century, there were several intermittent and ongoing excavation projects in the Dashur Necropolis.  The earliest archaeologists on site during this time were primarily Flinders Petrie, Jacques de Morgan, M.M. Gautier and Gustave Jequier.  (Petrie, 1888) (Bard, 1999).  All the major pyramids of the Dashur necropolis were explored during the last fifteen years of the 19th century, with several excavations taking place.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p><strong>20th CENTURY EXCAVATION PROJECTS</strong></p>
        <p>The completion of Morgan’s excavation of the Black Pyramid, begun in the 19th century, was accomplished through the efforts of the German Archaeological Institute of Cairo in 1988 (Lehner, 1997). Morgan’s initial excavation of Senusret III’s pyramid was continued in the 1990s by Dieter Arnold (Arnold, 2004).
        </p>

</figure>

        <p>The mastabas of the 12th dynasty were excavated further in 1994 by the Metropolitan Museum of Art (Arnold, 2004).  In 1952, Ahmed Fakhry found the funerary temple for the Bent Pyramid which contained some 1400 artifacts (Hawass).
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p><strong>LATE 20th to CURRENT EXCAVATIONS</strong></p>
        <p>With much of the exploration of the Dashur Necropolis structural remains completed by the end of the 20th century, archaeologists have more recently returned to the excavation of royal boats, also known as barques, that was begun in 1894 by Morgan.
        </p>

      <h3>RESULTS AND SIGNIFICANCE OF EXCAVATIONS</h3>
      <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
        <p>Flinders Petrie’s work in 1887 was primarily focused on the Bent Pyramid and its accompanying, much smaller, satellite pyramid.  Petrie was interested in mapping the Dashur site; only the two structures were mapped due to time constraints.  Petrie was also interested in the building materials used in the Bent Pyramid. Petrie is responsible for identifying the unstable foundation that the Bent Pyramid was built on(Petrie, 1888).
        </p>
        <p>Jacques de Morgan began excavating in the Dashur Necropolis in 1892. Morgan excavated the pyramid tomb of Senusret III, the Black Pyramid, in 1894 (Lehner, 1997). Though the original structure had collapsed, leaving just an empty granite sarcophagus, Morgan identified the former dimensions of Senusret III’s pyramid, and found foundations for a mortuary temple and a chapel-like structure (Arnold, 2002). Outside of the remains of a compound wall were found the mastabas (shaft tombs with monument structures erected over the opening to the tomb) of the royal female members of Senusret III’s family. Also in 1894-95, Morgan began excavation of Amenemhet II’s burial complex, which includes the remains of a pyramid commonly known as the “White Pyramid” today. A large amount of burial goods were found in the royal tombs found inside the remains of the complex outer walls (“More Light on Ancient Egypt”, 1894). The metalworking and jewelry found in the shaft tombs are some of the best examples of the high level of workmanship available in the Middle Kingdom period (Encyclopædia Britannica Online). </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Rainer Stadelmann and Dieter Arnold, two contemporary archaeologists have ongoing excavations at Dashur.  Stadelmann’s discoveries include discovery of a corner stone and limestone building blocks for the Red Pyramid, which revealed some dates of construction for portions of Sneferu’s pyramid (Bard, 1999).  Dieter Arnold, who has been working on the mastabas surrounding the Black Pyramid of Senusret III since 1995, to continue with Morgan’s work of a century earlier, has focused on the work of recreating the burial sites and structures based on the remains that have been found (Arnold, 2004).
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>In 2008, with the help of ground penetrating radar (GPR) technology, archaeologists searched for remains of a fifth Egyptian boat, hinted at in Morgan’s notes.  While it was determined that the GPR methodology was effective for this type of non-invasive survey, to date no additional evidence for a fifth barque has been found (Creasman, et al., 2009).

      <h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
     <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->

      <p>Despite well over a century of excavation projects involving the pyramids and surrounding structures at Dashur, much remains to be excavated.  Of the eleven known pyramids, only four have been excavated. While the remaining pyramids are little more than rubble, the recent problems with modern looters should be a signal to the archaeological community that the work at Dashur needs to continue for decades to come (Parcak, 2015).
