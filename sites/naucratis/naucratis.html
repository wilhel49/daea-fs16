         <h3>Introduction</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
		 <p>
		 	Naucratis (or Naukratis) was a Greek emporium established sometime between the 7th and 6th centuries, during the 26th Dynasty of the Late Period. It was likely first a military settlement granted by Pharaoh Psammetichus I to his Greek mercenaries, flourishing into a commercial center and polis later during the reign of the Saite dynasty. Regardless of its inception, the site is the first recorded instance of an organized Greek presence in Egypt, and came to symbolize a symbiotic relationship between the two cultures<a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Malouta, Myrto. (2015) Naucratis"> (Malouta)</a>.
		 </p>
		 <p>
		 	The archeological site has become world famous for it’s beautiful collections of Greek art, with some of the earliest examples of Greek writing found on broken pottery sherds. Though today much of the excavated city lies under a lake due to the rising water table<a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Villing, Alexandra., Thomas, Ross. The site of Naukratis: topography, buildings and landscape"> (Villing et al.)</a>, excavations have been ongoing while our view of the ancient trading colony has become both clearer and cloudier with each new find.

		 	<img src="img/mod_naukratis.jpg" width="100%" />
		 	<figcaption>Image 1 - "Naucratis, Lake Covering Much of the Site"</figcaption>
		 </figure>
		 <p>
		 	Today Naukratis is located between the Rosetta branch of the Nile (16km east of the site) and the Libyan plain (15km west), putting it near the western edge of the Nile Delta. While today there is no direct link with the Nile River itself, in antiquity it would have been located along the eastern bank of the Canopic branch of the Nile Delta, with the river still being wide and deep enough for seagoing vessels to enter, likely making it the most accessible of the Nile’s branches for international sea trade. The modern site is also located near the villages of Kom Ge’if, Nebira and El-Neqrash, with the center of the ancient town located under a partially dried lake<a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Villing, Alexandra. The site of Naukratis: a city and trading port in Egypt"> (Villing)</a>. 
		 </p>
		 <p>
		 	Connected to the capitol city of Memphis in the south, Naukratis was likely connected via canal to the city of Sais, 19km to its north-east, serving as the international port of the 26th Dynasty’s royal court. Naukratis was also linked to essential salt and natron sources in the regions of Barnugi (25km west) and Wadi Natrun (70km south) via the river port of Terenouthis, some 65 km upstream on the Canopic branch. Additionally Naukratis had rich agricultural hinterland, providing an opportunity to grow grain for both consumption and export<a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Villing, Alexandra., Thomas, Ross.

		 <h3>Site Description</h3>
		 <hr>
		 <figure style="float: right; width: 60%; padding-left: 20px; padding-bottom: 5px;">
		 	<img src="img/naukratis_map.jpg" width="100%" />
		 	<figcaption>Image 2 - "Naucratis, Plan of Excavated Site"</figcaption>
		 </figure>
		 <p>
		 	Recent magnetometry fieldwork has revealed that the archeological excavations undertaken in the 19th and 20th century expeditions covered only a portion of the much larger than expected city. Estimates put the size of the city at 60 hectares at its height with a population of over 13,000 people, making it one of the Dealta's larger settlements in antiquity. The city followed an organic, erratic layout identical to other Delta sites, alternating between densely packed neighborhoods, areas for industrial and public use and large sanctuary precincts. In the southern half of the city, along the riverbank, lay the sacred quay of the Egyptian temple and the town’s main harbor with it’s facilities and magazines<a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Villing, Alexandra., Thomas, Ross. The site of Naukratis: topography, buildings and landscape"> (Villing et al.)</a>.
		 </p>
		 <p>
		 	The Greek sanctuaries were located in the central and western areas of the town, all of them at one point containing temples, altars and  offerings. Unfortunately, much of the precincts have suffered damage from antiquity to modern times before they could be excavated, so knowledge of their layout and development overtime is limited. The sanctuaries themselves have been identified with the gods/goddesses Apollo, Hera, Aphrodite and the Dioskouroi, and the famous Hellenion mentioned by Herodotus, used for the combined worship of the Greek pantheon<a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Villing, Alexandra., Thomas, Ross. The site of Naukratis: topography, buildings and landscape"> (Villing et al.)</a>.
		 </p>
		 <p>
		 	To the south of the excavated site lies the “Great Temenos”, an enormous Egyptian temple structure likely dedicated to Amun-Ra, though originally believed to be the Hellenion by Petrie and Gardner. The structure was mapped to be 298m by 259m, covering nearly 8 hectares and surrounded by a massive mud brick enclosure wall. It’s massive limestone gateway is also one of the largest known in Egypt, measuring 107m by 24m<a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Villing, Alexandra., Thomas, Ross. The site of Naukratis: topography, buildings and landscape"> (Villing et al.)</a>.
		 </p>
		 <p>
		 	Past the sanctuary gates, Naukratis was densely populated with houses, storage buildings, and workshops. Information from Petrie’s maps and recent magnetometry has revealed the town was dominated by traditional Egyptian tall tower houses and irregular terraced buildings. Magazines and workshops were interspersed among homes, the most famous being a faience workshop that created small scarab ornaments, found in the souther area of the site<a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Villing, Alexandra., Thomas, Ross. The site of Naukratis: topography, buildings and landscape"> (Villing et al.)</a>.
		 </p>
		 <p>
		 	In the northern end of the city lies a cemetery spanning from the Archaic to Roman period, while along the western edge lied the Canopic branch of the Nile River. The entire riverfront probably acted as the town’s harbor, with man-made terraced retaining walls and long magazine-like structures built along the river's course. In the north and central areas of the riverbank, the harbor would have been dedicated to merchant work, while in the southern area the harbor would’ve acted as a sacred quay, connected to the theorized temple of Amun-Ra by a processional way<a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Villing, Alexandra., Thomas, Ross. The site of Naukratis: topography, buildings and landscape"> (Villing et al.)</a>.
		 </p>
		 <p>
		 	There may also be temples dedicated to Zeus, Athena and a polestar dedicated to Apollo, as mentioned by Herodotus and other ancient inscriptions. Though tese structures have not yet been discovered, they could very possibly exist under the many hectares of the city still remaining to be excavated<a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Villing, Alexandra., Thomas, Ross. The site of Naukratis: topography, buildings and landscape"> (Villing et al.)</a>.
		 </p>
		 <br>
		 <h3>Excavations</h3>
		 <hr>
		 <p>
		 	Flinders Petrie was the first archeologist to properly identify and excavate the site of Naukratis. Upon arriving on December 1st, 1884, Petrie found a Tell covering an area of 950x580m, already deeply scarred by sebbakhin and littered with Greek pottery dug up and tossed aside by the workers. With the first few days he found a Greek inscription on the gateway of a house mentioning Naukratis, at long last identifying the site as Naukratis proper<a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Villing, Alexandra. Discovery and excavations: Naukratis from the 19th century until today"> (Villing et al.)</a>.
		 </p>
		 <p>
		 	Excavations on the north end of the site revealed the temenos of Apollo, including hundreds of fragments of bowls incised with dedicatory inscriptions to Apollo and fragments of limestone columns in a honeysuckle pattern. The first temple was believed to be destroyed during the Persian invasions, replaced by a second temple with white marble as shown by fragments painted in rich reds and blues. Just north of the temenos lay another temenos, this one being dedicated to the Dioskouri. South of both the temenoi lay what Petrie thought was the palaistra (later revealed to be the tenemos of Hera by Gardner), a large, open area without any ruins and bounded by thick walls on three of its sides. A temenos to Aphrodite was located in the south-western part of town, identified by a piece of a dedicated bowl of “Phoenician-Greek” ware<a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Petrie, Flinders. (1885). The Discovery of Naukratis. The Journal of Hellenic Studies. 6 202-206."> (Petrie p203)</a>.

		 	<img src="img/scarab.jpg" width="100%" />
		 	<figcaption>Image 3 - "Faience Mold from Scarab Factory"</figcaption>
		 </figure>
		 <p>
		 	Paying the sebbakhin market value for any archeological finds they brought to him, Petrie left excavation of the residential districts in the central and southern areas of the site to the them, though he followed their excavations closely, mapping the streets and areas of craftsmen’s workshops. The streets were small, about 7 to 8 feet wide, traceable by the trash thrown from houses and streaks of stone dust used for filling up puddles<a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Villing, Alexandra. Discovery and excavations: Naukratis from the 19th century until today"> (Villing et al.)</a>. The potters quarter is located east of the temenos of Hera, identified by the kilns and heaps of burnt earth, while the iron-smelter’s quarter was found south of the potter’s, as shown by the hematite ore, iron slag, and quantities of chisels and stone tools dated to around the 6th century B.C. In the western side of town was discovered the scarab faience factory, with hundreds of molds containing the blundered names of Amasis and Psamtik I and II. Around 2-3 feet below the scarab factory, Petrie also noticed a burnt stratum underlying all the southern half of the town, which he attributed to the burning of a first settlement of wattle and daub shanties of the Greek traders during the Assyrian or Ethiopian conquests<a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Petrie, Flinders. (1885). The Discovery of Naukratis. The Journal of Hellenic Studies. 6 202-206."> (Petrie p204)</a>.
		 </p>
		 <p>
		 	Just outside of the town and to the south was a great enclosure 600 feet square with walls fifty feet thick and over thirty high, which was nicknamed “The Great Temenos”. Around half of the western side of the enclosure contained a building probably put down by Ptolemy II, since underneath the corner of each foundation Petrie discovered caches of  tools and materials bearing his name. At the entrance of the building was located a pylon with two broken rams made of white marble with a dedicatory inscription to Zeus, suggesting the building was a temple dedicated to him. While the rest of the enclosure was largely open, unused space, there existed a string of small buildings along the north side, and two large crude brick buildings in the south containing deep, isolated chambers<a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Petrie, Flinders. (1885). The Discovery of Naukratis. The Journal of Hellenic Studies. 6 202-206."> (Petrie p204-205)</a>.
		 </p>
		 <p>
		 	Among the countless artifacts found, Petrie discovered a vast supply of pottery sherds ranging in style and numerous amphorae handles, which would aid him considerably in his seriation methods. Furthermore, he had discovered a great quantity of scales, more than had been excavated in all of Egypt at the time, emphasizing the critical role Naucratis played in Egyptian foreign trade as an emporium<a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Petrie, Flinders. (1885). The Discovery of Naukratis. The Journal of Hellenic Studies. 6 202-206."> (Petrie p206)</a>.
		 </p>
		 <p>
		 	Itching to move on to other undiscovered sites, Petrie went back to Naukratis the next year to train Ernest Gardner so he could take over the site and allow Petrie to explore the eastern Delta<a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Villing, Alexandra. Discovery and excavations: Naukratis from the 19th century until today"> (Villing et al.)</a>. Excavating over the winter of 1885/86, Gardner noted that the sebbakhin, though nearly destroying the Great Temenos and altering the tell substantially, had provided a service to the archeologists by revealing new strata and sites while also supplying far more artifacts than any series of test pits and trenches could have<a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Gardner, Arthur. (1888). Naukratis (pp9-29)"> (Gardner p10)</a>.

		 	<figcaption>Image 4 - "Chian Bowl from Temenos of Aphrodite"</figcaption>
		 </figure>
		 <p>
		 	Their first excavations at the Temenos of Dioskouroi provided plaster faced, oblong mud-brick structures that were either the bases of pillars or the lower portion of the pillars themselves. Able to deduce this was the portico of the front of the temple, Gardner and Petrie then found small fragments of votive vases to add to their voluminous pottery collection. Working on the temenos of Aphrodite, Gardner and Petrie were also able to ascertain a clearer floorpan of the temple itself and discovered an altar for burnt offerings containing ashes and fragments of bone, along with more votive pottery fragments including a rich stratum of what Gardner called “the finest painted and inscribed vases”. Additionally, Gardner was able to discern that what Petrie had thought to be the palaistra as actually the temenos of Hera after discovering fragments of votive pottery and the foundations of a building in the enclosure<a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Gardner, Arthur. (1888). Naukratis (pp9-29)"> (Gardner p11-12)</a>.
		 </p>
		 <p>
		 	Further discoveries were also made near the Great Temenos, where Gardner discovered the causeway leading from the temple to the sacred quay. He also found a granite sphinx from the Ptolemaic period that had been broken apart. After further excavations in the surrounding area, Gardner and his crew were able to reconstruct it, missing only the face<a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Gardner, Arthur. (1888). Naukratis (pp9-29)"> (Gardner p13-14)</a>.
		 </p>
		 <p>
		 	One of the original goals of this second expedition was to locate and excavate the cemetery. This Gardner did early on, discovering it in the far northwestern area of the site, yet the findings proved rather disappointing. Excavating the entirety of the known cemetery not covered by nearby villages, Gardner was only able to find a few gravestones, some of which were found in the city limits and converted to more practical uses such as forming part of a pavement. Similarly no tomb-chambers were ever found, though one or two graves dating to the Roman period were made of burnt brick. No cremations were discovered either, and the famous Egyptian practice of embalming the dead does not seem to have been applied, as the bodies had always completely disappeared, with even the bones being badly preserved. Coffins were usually made of wood, which naturally did not last for excavators to salvage, or terracotta which by this point had been crushed under the weight of the earth. However, young children seem to have been interred inside amphorae, with the top broken off to allow the body to be inserted. There were a number of common grave goods, including iron combs, bronze bangles, pottery, etc., but nothing like the more lavish artifacts found in the temenoi<a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Gardner, Arthur. (1888). Naukratis (pp9-29)"> (Gardner p21-29)</a>.
		 </p>
		 <p>
		 	A third expedition was undertaken by Gardner in 1888, yet he admitted there was unlikely anything significant for archeologists to find at the moment, though in time the sebbakhin may reveal more promising strata at Naukratis. In 1899 David Hogarth, another British archeologist, conducted a fourth expedition under the auspices of the British School of Athens after learning that the sebbakhin had indeed made considerable work on the tell at Naukratis<a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Villing, Alexandra. Discovery and excavations: Naukratis from the 19th century until today"> (Villing et al.)</a>.

		 	<figcaption>Image 5 - "Naukratis, 1899 Excavation"</figcaption>
		 </figure>
		 <p>
		 	Implementing the same methods as Petrie and Gardner by employing the local sebbakhin and marking the stratigraphic sequence of the site, Hogarth focused his excavation on the north-eastern and southern areas of the site. In the north-east the structures uncovered were both complex and multi-period, consisting of an enclosure wall and several buildings in which votive offerings were found naming individual gods such as Apollo, Herakles, Zeus, and Aphrodite among others. It was the multitude of these offerings that prompted Hogarth to declare he had found the actual site of the Hellenion, deducing the large complex to the south of the site was in fact an Egyptian complex. Hogarth also discovered a large cache of beautiful Greek and Ptolemaic terracotta figurines that captured the eyes of museum collectors around the world<a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Villing, Alexandra. Discovery and excavations: Naukratis from the 19th century until today"> (Villing et al.)</a>.
		 </p>
		 <p>
		 	During his second expedition in 1903, Hogarth focused on exploring the “Great Temenos” in the south of the site that he now considered to be an entirely Egyptian structure, possibly a fort, market area, or religious structure. No plan of this excavation was ever published, with Hogarth having difficulty relating what he found in his trenches to the structure Petrie had described, in part due to the near demolition of the site undergone by the sebbakhin throughout the bye years. Hogarth even claimed such a massive structure did not exist, and instead what Petrie had found was an area for Egyptian living quarters intersperse with religious sanctuaries, a claim that is improbable due the massive pylon and casement building that could only have formed part of an enormous sanctuary<a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Villing, Alexandra. Discovery and excavations: Naukratis from the 19th century until today"> (Villing et al.)</a>.
		 </p>
		 <p>
		 	After the 1903 excavations, Naukratis remained untouched by archeologists until 1977 when an American mission under William Coulson and Albert Leonard Jr. conducted a large-scale field survey, limited excavations and a program of core drillings. Undertaking a more scientific, modern approach than previous expeditions, Coulson and Leonard hoped to establish a modern typology of pottery at the site, a stratigraphic sequence against which the results of earlier excavations could take place and a wider understanding of the topographical setting of the site. Excavations took place in the area of the Great Temenos and on a mound east of the central part of the site known as a ceramic “trash heap”<a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Villing, Alexandra. Discovery and excavations: Naukratis from the 19th century until today"> (Villing et al.)</a>.
		 </p>
		 <p>
		 	While many of the mission’s findings are suggested to have been flawed if not downright false, such as suggesting the Canopic branch flowed across the site during the whole first millennium B.C., the hoard of pottery collected from both survey and excavations provides a crucial counterbalance to the focus of the first four seasons on painted, inscribed Greek pottery. Unfortunately, Leonard misaligned Petrie’s maps, confusing the mound over the casement-building in the “Great Tenemos” with the mound over the southwest corner of it’s enclosure wall, placing the structure too far southwest and making it impossible to successfully trace. Furthermore, Leonard made the erroneous claim that none of the artifacts excavated at the southern mound pre-date or post-dated the Ptolemaic Period, despite acknowledging himself  later in the paper that the earliest layers did indeed contain Pre-Ptolemaic pottery, and a few pieces of "Ptolemaic" pottery were later reclassified as Late-Dynastic<a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Villing, Alexandra. Discovery and excavations: Naukratis from the 19th century until today"> (Villing et al.)</a>.

		 	<figcaption>Image 6 - "British Museum Fieldwork 2013"</figcaption>
		 </figure>
		 <p>
		 	With the American mission under intense scrutiny, the British Museum sent a mission to undertake three brief seasons in 2012, 2013 and 2014 as part of the interdisciplinary Naukratis project that has been ongoing since 2003. While the final reports of these findings have not yet been released, preliminary reports on magnetometry fieldwork has revealed the city of Naukratis to be far larger than previously expected, and in much better condition than the American mission had assumed, despite the lake currently covering the central area of the site. The mission also believes they have located a much more reasonable location for the Canopic river along with it’s ancient quays, and they’ve identified the “Great Temenos” as an Egyptian temple of Amun Ra instead of the Greek Hellenion, which they believe to be the structure Hogarth had discovered earlier. When the results are published and scrutinized over, they will undoubtedly add a much clearer picture to the still murky site of Naukratis<a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Villing, Alexandra.

		 <h3>Results</h3>
		 <hr>
		 <figure style="float: left; width: 50%; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 5px;">
		 	<img src="img/naukratis_gps.jpg" width="100%" />

		 </figure>
		 <p>
		 	The results of Petrie’s excavations laid the groundwork for all future missions. With the obvious fact that he actually discovered the site, it was also Petrie who identified the numerous temples ascribed to Naukratis by Herodotus. Petrie’s work also revealed the significance of Naukratis as a trading site, with hundreds of scales used for trade and merchant work and the scarab faience factory whose products have been found in the graves of mainland Greece<a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Malouta, Myrto. (2015) Naucratis"> (Malouta)</a>. Petrie was also the first to discover the “Great Temenos” which, though still debated, appears to have been an Egyptian fort or temple which would indicate a strong Egyptian presence in an otherwise all Greek town.
		 </p>
		 <p>
		 	Gardner’s excavations helped to further clarify Petrie’s original expedition while adding new data itself. Discovering the actual Temple of Aphrodite and identifying what Petrie believed to be a palaistra as the temenos of Hera, Gardner redrew the known map of Naukratis. He also discovered the cemetery, which through it’s less impressive grave remains (compared to those found in the city of Naukratis itself) suggests the site was occupied well after Naukratis had waned as a significant emporium. The lack of Egyptian burial customs also reveals a strong foreign culture residing in Egypt and maintaining its own norms and customs<a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Malouta, Myrto. (2015) Naucratis"> (Malouta)</a>.
		 </p>
		 <p>
		 	The expedition undertaken by Hogarth provided even more modification on the layout of Naukratis. After discovering the actual Hellenion in the northwest of the site, Hogarth was the first to suggest that Petrie’s “Great Temenos” was actually an Egyptian structure, which in his opinion he believed to be a fort for an Egyptian garrison to keep tabs on the foreign Greeks. Finally discovering the Hellenion itself also verified Homer’s most sought after structure in Naucratis, putting to sleep a long time quest viewed with much romanticism in the 19th and early 20th century.
		 </p>
		 <p>
		 	While the results of the American mission may have been flawed in part by honest misjudgment, they still contributed a treasure trove of plain-ware, undecorated pottery sherds. Though perhaps less impressive, these sherds are crucial to setting up systematic sampling strategies, with many are still being processed and analyzed today<a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Villing, Alexandra. Discovery and excavations: Naukratis from the 19th century until today"> (Villing et al.)</a>.
		 </p>
		 <p>
		 	With the British Museum still working on publishing their findings, what little data they have shared is already changing our knowledge of Naukratis. This include magnetometry fieldwork that shows not even half of the site has been excavated and theories the “Great Temenos” is actually a temple complex dedicated to the Egyptian god Amun-Ra.
		 </p>
		 <p>
		 	The results of all these excavations reveal an evolving picture of Naukratis, never static and always requiring a reevaluation of our current narrative for the site. Future excavations and studies will undoubtedly have a similar effect on our knowledge of this mysterious site.

		 </p>
		 <br>
		 <h3>Conclusion</h3>
		 <hr>
		 <p>
		 	Naukratis is truly unlike any other Egyptian site. The only Greek colony in the country before Alexander the Great’s conquest, it was more than a foreign emporium, Naukratis was a nexus for Greek and Egyptian ideas to intermingle and shape one another. As the trading port for the royal city of Sais, Naukratis was also the only entrance for foreign goods entering Egypt according to ancient sources, making it even more important to the supply of elite goods for a ruling dynasty very much in need to flaunt their power and authority<a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Malouta, Myrto. (2015) Naucratis"> (Malouta)</a>.

		 	The city also acts as a bridge to all Egyptian archeological sites, as most exports leaving on foreign ships would find their transport docked at the quays along Naucratis. Furthermore, grain and other essentials were transported to Naucratis from nearby villages, allowing the town to focus almost exclusively on trade. Acting as a point for both exports and imports into the Late Period Egyptian State, Naucratis was in some respects even more connected to the Egyptian cities than the royal capitol of Memphis itself.
