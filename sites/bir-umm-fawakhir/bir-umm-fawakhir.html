			<p> Bir Umm Fawakhir is the site of a fifth to sixth century Byzantine/Coptic
			gold-mining town located in Egypt’s Eastern Desert (6). While there are pharaonic period
			pot sherds and the Turin Papyrus Map give evidence to suggest human activities
			as early the New Kingdom (1), most evidence suggests the site was primarily inhabited in the Coptic period.
			From the expedition by University of Chicago's
			Oriental Institute, we have learned a great deal about the settlement. Evidence suggests that
			the town was occupied periodically, only when the mines were in use(7). Further, archaeologists have concluded
			that the scale of operation of the mines suggests that it was financed and supported by a large
			institution, namely the government of the area.

		<h3>LOCATION AND GEOGRAPHY</h3>

			<p> In the Eastern desert, about five kilometers northeast of the famous Wadi
			Hammamt and between jagged granite cliffs in a patch of wide, flat land lies 
			the site of Bir Umm Fawakhir. The sandy, wadi bottom serves as the main street
			of the site, with the steep granite cliffs acting as natural walls to the settlement
			and as construction limits to the growth of the town (4). Due to this location in
			the hyperarid desert, the only natural resources are the minerals contained in the
			mountains that surround the site; granite, gold and quartz were all mined extensively
			at various times. The wells at the feet of these mountains, due to the granite that
			carries water, are also a critical factor in the ability for a population to occupy this area.

		<h3>SITE DESCRIPTION</h3>

				Ancient House and Silo that was used as an Animal Pen </figcaption> </a>
				</figure>
				
			<p>The site consists of a main settlement, with domestic structures of typically
			two or three rooms on both sides of the wadi, and fourteen clusters of structures
			outside of this main area that are of the same time frame (5). Population estimates
			for the estimated 237 structures (7), most of which are interpreted to be domestic,
			hovers around 1000 inhabitants (4). The mountains surrounding the site show evidence
			of ancient mining of gold, quartz, and granite. Within the site there is a small
			granite outcropping, known as the hillock, which two substantial buildings and several 
			smaller structures that suggest potential status differences or functional differences
			than the rest of the community (4). However, the rest of the domestic structures do not
			suggest any major status hierarchies as none are more elaborate than any other (3). East
			of the wells runs a Roman road, which provides an opportunity for dating. There are a
			multitude of one-room structures and a variety of interpretations and potential uses for
			them; smaller one-room buildings could have been latrines, while larger ones have been 
			interpreted as animal shelters, but many have left researchers unsure on their use. Apart
			from the main town settlement are several outliers. The outlier that lies north of the
			settlement, is known as Outlier 2, contains a quarry and is presumed to be Roman (4). 
			This settlement has been interpreted as being residential and not temporarily inhabited
			like the rest of Bir Umm Fawakhir (4).

		<h3> EXCAVATION AND RESULTS </h3>

			<p>Bir Umm Fawakhir is the first archaeologically studied gold sources within the Byzantine Empire
			and like the emperor’s personal appointees and their administration were involved in the mines (3).
			There has only been one archaeological expedition for survey and excavation at Bir Umm Fawakhir.
			The University of Chicago initially began an archaeological survey of the site in 1992 and continued
			to excavate and survey extensively until 2001. The project began with the intention to map the site
			and do a type of salvage archaeology through surface pottery to preserve a record of the site. 
			The first year the expedition was able to do excavation was in 1999, after they had spent four seasons 
			surveying the entirety of the site.  </p>
			
			<p>Much of the site consists of domestic structures, which are typically two to three room
			independent structures although sometimes present themselves as larger agglomerated houses with as
			many as twenty-two rooms or a small as one room buildings. Two houses, Buildings 93 and 177, and one
			outbuilding, Building 181 were chosen for the one season excavation at Bir Umm Fawakhir (7). </p>
  	
				
			<p>Building 93 is a domestic structure that was chosen for its remarkable level of preservation as well
			as its appearance being “otherwise utterly ordinary” (7) The six rooms of Building 93 were originally
			interpreted to be four interconnected rooms with two supplementary non-interconnecting room, after further
			investigation the researchers interpreted the structure to be an agglomeration of two houses (7). The 
			agglomeration of houses appears to be fairly common at Bir Umm Fawakhir, with the town growing through 
			sprawl of homes, rooms, and the “capture” of nearby structures (7).  Objects found within the structure
			were not the “utterly” normal pieces they were expecting. Items such as a copper/gold-alloy bracelet in
			room A, an iron wedge, iron ladle, raw emeralds, and an amulet of Bes are pieces that allow archaeologists 
			insight into the lives of the individuals that lived and worked at Bir Umm Fawakhir. For example, the Bes
			amulet is present at a site that has been dated to the Christianized era of Egypt yet represents the
			traditional Egyptian beliefs. This suggests that “something of the old beliefs survived or the new beliefs
			were being interpreted in light of the old,” (5) and provides an interesting look into the lives of the miners outside of their job.   </p>

				<figcaption> <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="Meyer, Carol. In Bir Umm Fawakhir 3: Excavations 1999-2001. 2014." data-content="Image 5. Top Plan of Building 93"> 
				</figcaption> </a>
				</figure>
			
			<p>We can draw larger conclusions from the evidence found in this structure as well. Multiple rooms in
			Building 93 point to at least three layers of occupation, providing support to the idea that the mines
			at Bir Umm Fawakhir were worked only intermittently, when there was demand from the government or those
			wealthy enough to support the massive undertaking of ancient gold mining, (7) Additionally, Building 93
			revealed that the level of the wadi bottom in ancient times was much lower than where it currently lies.
			Room E had 70 centimeters of fill above the cultural remains, so where the preservation from the outside
			looked lacking, the inside of the structure revealed a much higher level of preservation. </p>
			
			<p>Building 177 was chosen because of both its unusual location being on the hillock as well as its large
			concentration of dipinti and decorated plates. The hillock, as mentioned in previous sections, is a granite
			outcropping on which Building 177 is located. Mapped in seasons previous to the excavation year, Building
			177 was described as a “very solidly built four-room house.” (7). Evidence suggests two stages of occupation
			in the structure, both of which were periods of habitation within the building as evidenced by a hearth, beads,
			coins and dipinti. The multiple layers of occupation, similar to what was found in other structures at the site,
			suggests that the mines were used intermittently. </p>
			
			<p>Drawing from the totality of the excavation at Bir Umm Fawakhir, the team from University of Chicago concluded
			that the town was built up over time through sprawl, rather than through a form of urban planning. (7) Further, 
			this site was used only when gold from the mines was needed or some institution, most likely the government, 
			financed the mines and supported the miners. There is nothing to suggest that miners were prisoners of war or
			criminals; granaries found look to be for households instead of holding large amounts of ration (7). Additionally,
			there does not appear to be much in the way of formal defense, to keep people in or out, besides the one noted
			guard post that gives a wide view of the surrounding area (3). While there is nothing to directly prove that women
			or children were present, one could extrapolate the finding of beads and gold jewelry to be evidence for the
			occupation of women at the site. However, this assumes that men did not wear jewelry. Although associated cemeteries
			have not been systematically excavated to understand the population from a bioarchaeological perspective, researchers
			believe that women and families were present at Bir Umm Fawakhir. It is further noted that while men could have
			performed domestic duties such as cooking and cleaning, these were typically jobs for women and children and would
			have fallen to them. A final report on the excavations done at Bir Umm Fawakhir concluded with the fact that the
			excavated building make up approximately 1.3% of just the surveyed structures at the site and acknowledged that further
			investigation would certainly change the overall understanding and the conclusions that have been drawn. (7) </p>

		<h3> CONCLUSIONS </h3>
			<p>Bir Umm Fawakhir was a Coptic period mining town that was most likely intermittently inhabited by miners and their
			families. Periodic occupation suggests that the mining operation was highly organized by a large institution, most
			likely the government, and supported the miners and their families while they worked at the site. Considering that Bir
			Umm Fawakhir was one of the first archaeologically studied gold sources in the Byzantine Empire, it contributes 
			massively to the understanding of the gold industry for the empire. For broader understanding of ancient Egypt, the
			presence of pharaonic era objects could suggest earlier use of the site and provide insight on mining in that age as
			well; the Bes amulet displays the longevity of influence of the traditional religion in ancient Egypt, even in the 
			Christianized Coptic period.   </p>
