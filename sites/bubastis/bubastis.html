		 		Bubastis, also known as Tell Basta, is situated on the east bank of a Nile branch. It was founded around the 4th Dynasty,
		 		 but became well known when it became a royal residence during the 22nd Dynasty. It was also the capital of the 
		 		 Delta region of Am-Khent, which contributed to its long inhabitation period. Bubastis was also the center for the cult 
		 		 of Bast (also known as Bastet), a cat goddess associated with protection and family. She was later identified with the 
		 		 Greek goddess Artemis and was worshiped in Bubastis even after the invasion of foreign armies into ancient Egypt.

		<h3>Location</h3>
		<hr>
			<p>
				Tell Basta, also known as Bubastis in Greek and Per-Bast in Egyptian, is located on the eastern bank of the Pelusiac 
				branch of the Nile River and sits in the middle of the Nile Delta region of Egypt. In ancient times, it was also the 
				capital of its own nome, or region. Because of its geographical location, Bubastis’ soil is saturated with water for most 
				of the year and that, in turn, makes it very difficult for artifacts to be preserved and excavated.

			The city of Bubastis consists of multiple buildings or structures, including three cemeteries, the Temple of Pepi, the Temple 
			of Bastet, a royal palace, and the main city. Due to the discovery of reused stone blocks bearing the names of Khufu and 
			Khafre, the cult center was founded around the 4th Dynasty. The Bubastis site is well known for its temple complexes and 
			described great beauty by ancient historians. A quote from Herodotus’ writings paint a vivid picture of how Bubastis might 
			have looked in its prime:
				<p>
				<i>
				"Temples there are more spacious and costlier than that of Bubastis, but none so pleasant to behold. It is after the 
				following fashion. Except at the entrance, it is surrounded by water: for two canals branch off from the river, and run as 
				far as the entrance to the temple: yet neither canal mingles with the other, but one runs on this side, and the other on 
				that. Each canal is a hundred feet wide, and its banks are lined with trees. The propylaea are sixty feet in height, and 
				are adorned with sculptures (probably intaglios in relief) nine feet high, and of excellent workmanship. The Temple being 
				in the middle of the city is looked down upon from all sides as you walk around; and this comes from the city having been 
				raised, whereas the temple itself has not been moved, but remains in its original place. Quite round the temple there goes 
				a wall, adorned with sculptures. Within the inclosure is a grove of fair tall trees, planted around a large building in 
				which is the effigy (of Bast). The form of that temple is square, each side being a stadium in length. In a line with the 
				entrance is a road built of stone about three stadia long, leading eastwards through the public market. The road is about 
				400 feet (120 m) broad, and is flanked by exceeding tall trees. It leads to the temple of Hermes."
				</i>
				</p>
			Although most sites located in the Nile Delta have been immensely degraded due to water damage, Bubastis has remained fairly 
			pristine (Tell Basta Project, n.d.). One well-known stonework from Bubastis is an image of Hathor on a capital, or column 
			topper. Hathor is commonly associated and found together with Bastet because they were both daughters of Amun-Re and shared 
			some attributes with each other. The sculpture was discovered by Edouard Naville in his excavations in the late 1800’s and is 
			one of the only remaining, well-preserved pieces of the main temple complex’s architecture. This Hathor capital was uncovered 
			in the main hall of the temple. It is made of red granite and weighs over 3,600 kilograms. It has images of Hathor on two 
			opposite sides, with the other two sides containing the cartouche of its commissioner, Osorkon II (874-850 BC). It was once 
			painted with vivid colors, but has since faded, although Naville wrote that, ‘when we raised it, the lips were still covered 
			with a vivid red paint (Column capital..., n.d.).
			</p>
			<p>
			Bubastis was the center of religion and worship of the cat goddess, Bast (or Bastet), for millennia. The main temple in the 
			city is dedicated to her and a large festival was thrown annually to celebrate the goddess. These festivals were well 
			documented by ancient historians such as Herodotus. Although the main temple was originally built in the 4th Dynasty, 
			Bastet’s temple is thought to have been updated throughout the centuries by various pharaohs, including Rameses II, whose 
			statues are some of the most well preserved artifacts at the site.  
			</p>
			<p>
				Tell Basta was also a major center of administration for Lower Egypt. It was the capital of the nome of Am-Khent, or the 
				18th nome of Lower Egypt and was the center of power for the region. At the beginning of the 22nd Dynasty (around 943 BC), 
				the pharaoh, Shoshenq I, moved the royal residence to Bubastis. This allowed the city to be much more influential to the 
				country as a whole.
			</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Excavations</h3>
		<hr>
			<p>
				Bubastis has been excavated many times within the last three hundred years. One famous excavation was carried out by 
				Edouard Naville in 1888 with the Egypt Exploration Fund (today known as the Egypt Exploration Society). Another excavation 
				by Shafik Farid in 1964 discovered the tomb of Iuty, the vizer during the late New Kingdom. A recent excavation took place 
				from 2001 to 2008 by the Tell Basta Project, an Egyptian-German Joint Mission between the University of Göttingen Germany 
				and the Supreme Council of Antiquities in Egypt. Further excavations by this group are still being conducted today.  
			</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Results and Significance of Excavations</h3>
		<hr>

				>Image 4</a> - "Statue of a royal woman, built at the time of Ramses II"</figcaption>
	
			</figure>
			<p>
				The excavation in 2001 uncovered and studied a naos for ‘Bastet, Lady of the Shrine’ (Rosenow, 2008). A naos is a small shrine usually 
				housed within the inner sanctum of a temple and may house a statue of the god or goddess associated with that temple. 
				There have been multiple naos found at Bubastis, but the recently discovered example is very large and more heavily 
				decorated than most others. The naos has been reconstructed from a seven pieces of adorned limestone, some which had 
				already been excavated in previous years. The newly discovered fragments were found in the western area of the Great 
				Temple of Bastet. This portion of the temple is known to have been constructed during the reign of Nekhthorheb II, and 
				consists of a few buildings. One such building most likely housed the newly reconstructed naos. Some decorations and text 
				on the recovered fragments show Nekhthorheb II venerating the Lady Bastet four times. A particularly interesting scene on 
				the exterior of the naos depicts a smetewy scene. A smetewy ceremony is the process of coronation the pharaoh at the 
				beginning of his or her reign. A depiction like this might indicate a similar ceremony might have taken place at Bubastis. 
				This would elevate the importance of the city and reflects the history of the city in the Late Period. Some Egyptologists 
				also believe that the naos may have once held a golden statue of the goddess. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Other excavations such as Edouard Naville’s in the late 1800’s and Shafik Farid's in 1964 have unearthed many artifacts and 
				discovered the true age of the site. Even today, excavations are discovering new finds, such as a very well preserved copy 
				of the Decree of Canopus in 2004, which was written around 238 BCE (Robinson, E., 2005).
			</p>

		<h3>Conclusion</h3>
		<hr>
			<p>
				Bubastis was a center for both religion and politics for centuries.  Its temple to Bastet and the festivals associated 
				with the goddess made it an influential location for Egyptians and foreigners alike. As the temple and following for 
				Bastet grew, the importance of her dedicated city flourished. It continued to be a significant site up through the Roman 
				Period with the integration of Roman gods and goddesses, where Bastet was associated with Artemis. This site has revealed 
				much about the significance of religious cultist cities and will continue to provide more information as more of it is 
				excavated.
