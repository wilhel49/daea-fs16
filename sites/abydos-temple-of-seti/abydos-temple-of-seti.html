         <h3>Intro</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
		 <p>The Temple of Seti I of Abydos construction began during the reign of Seti I (1318-1304 BC) this was later completed under the reign of his son, Ramses II (1304-1237 BC). The temple is known as the Great Temple of Abydos, this was built as a worship site not only for Pharaoh, but also the principal state deities. The temple included seven shrines, a pylon, two hypostyle halls, and two open courts. The temple is made of limestone in some areas, and in others is constructed in sandstone. (Bard p.113)  </p>
		 <br></br>
		 
		 
		 
		 <h3>Geography </h3>
		  
		 <hr></hr>
		 <p>Abydos is located within the low desert west of the Nile River near the Al-Bayanā. This area was a sacred place for the Egyptian god, Osiris. Abydos is also located 150 kilometers north of Luxo in southern Egypt, the floodplain within the area is very broad, and expands 14 kilometers from the west bank of the Nile to the high cliffs. Abydos is located about 11 kilometers from the bank of the Nile. It is hypothesized that the distance would have been less during the Dynastic period since the Nile has been gradually shifting eastward over the last 2,000 years. The North Abydos Votive Zone Project states that in ancient times, a canal would have linked to the Nile to make a larger irrigation and transportation system that extended through the cultivated area through the floodplain. This site also preserved eveidence of habitation and utilization from the Paleolithic to modern times. Greater Abydos is about 3 square kilometers and the ancient monuments here are placed in accordance with the flow of the Nile and not the cardinal directional points. The Temple of Seti I is located in the northern part of the site known as Arabah. (North Abydos)

</figure
<hr></hr>
<p>  As mentioned in Flinders Petrie’s book, <em>A History of Egypt vol. 3</em> the main part of the temple had been built by Seti I himself but “the completion of the front courts, and of the sculpturing, and the dedication of the temple, fell into the young king’s reign [Ramsees II]” Petrie also stated that Ramses felt that the temple was unfinished and columns were not on their bases and statues were laying on the earth, it was also asserted that Rameses II ordered that the pylons, and walls be finished, as the hypostyle halls were already completed. Petrie believed that Rameses II took pride in finishing Seti I’s temple but the walls being filled with Rameses II own scenes overshadowed it. (p.41) In Bard’s <em>Encyclopedia of the Archaeology of Ancient Egypt,</em> she states, “the southeast interior wall of the first court contains a representation of Rameses II fighting the Hittites at Qadesh. The names of Mereptah, Rameses III and Ramese IV are also preserved on these front courts. (p.114) There are also seven shrines within the temple and are dedicated to six gods and Seti I, himself. Those other six gods are, going from the southernmost chapel in order, are Seti I, Ptah, Re-Horakhty, Amen-Re, Osiris, Isis and Horus. (Bard, p.113) The seven shrines are broad and are accessed through the two hypostyle halls; one of the halls has two columns, while the other has three.  The seven shrines are decorated with the scenes from the daily cult ritual, which shows the king entering the shrine, offering and anointing the god’s statue and leaving while sweeping away his footprints as he leaves. Six of the shrines had a false depicted on the Western wall for what was thought as a way for the deity to enter the temple, the only shrine that does not have this extra door is the shrine for Osiris. Instead it is noted that there is an actual door that leads to a suite of rooms at the back of the temple where Osiris was celebrated. There is graffiti within the temple left behind later in Egyptian history that is written in the languages of Armaic, Phoenician, Carlan. Greek and Cypriot. (Bard, p.114)</p>

<h3>Osireion</h3>

<figcaption><a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Margaret. Osireion. Flickr, accessed 5 November 2016.">Image 3</a> - "Osireion"</figcaption>
</figure>
<hr></hr>
<p> The Osireion is a subterranean structure located directly behind the shrines. This is built in the shape of an 18th dynasty tomb. This building is entered from the north side through a long passage decorated with scenes with the <em> Book of Gates</em>. Going down the next corridor leads westward toward the main axis of the temple. The halls leading to this temple is decorated with mythological scenes including some from <em>the Book of the Dead</em>. There is also a large hall built from red granite and two platforms that are surrounded by a water-filled moat. Reliefs were later added to the Osireion by Seti I’s grandson, Merentaph. There is graffiti within the Osireion that indicates that pilgrims had visited it from the 21st dynasty until the Roman period. (Bard, p.114)  </p>
 

<h3>Abydos Kings List</h3>
<figure style="float: left; width: 35%; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 5px;">
<img src="img/abydoskingslist.jpg" width="100%" />
<figcaption><a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content="kairoinfo4u. Abydos King's List. Flickr, accessed 25 October 2016.">Image 4</a> - "Abydos King's List"</figcaption>
</figure>
<hr></hr>
<p>The Abydos King’s list is one of the more prominent findings from the Temple of Seti I . This list gives archaeologists a better understanding of who had ruled from the first dynasty to the nineteenth dynasty. Like many other Pharaoh in the past, this king’s list has some names omitted for what Seti had deemed illegitimate rulers. This list consists of 76 Kings and Pharaohs, included is 3 rows with 38 cartouches in each row.  Of those omitted from the list are Smenkhkare, Tutankhamen, and Akhenaten. This was a way “to erase their reigns from recorded history.” (Bard, p.113) This list is an important key in understanding the Kings and Pharaohs from the first couple of dynasties, this list is also one of the most complete King’s lists that have been found. (Bard, p.113) </p>

<h3>Past and Current Abydos Excavations</h3>
<hr></hr>
<p>The city of Abydos was found and excavated by Flinders Petrie in the years of 1901-03 and is in a site that is approximately 76,800 square meters.  However, much of the archaeological and textual data was fragmentary and difficult to interpret at parts. It is noted that the entire area of Abydos is a sacred area for the god Osiris and many of the other buildings and temples are dedicated to him in one form or another. (North Abydos). As mentioned in the section labeled “Temple” Petrie examined the areas of the Temple of Seti I and what he had built as well as what Seti I’s son, Rameses II had added onto.  Recently there had been a project done in 1996 under direction of Dr. Mary-Ann Pouls Wagner, the research program “incorporates topographical and archaeological survey as well as selective excavation, and is being carried out under the auspices of the University of Pennsylvania-Yale University-Institute of Fine Arts, New York University Expedition to Abydos (Drs. David O’Connor and William Kelly Simpson, co-directors)” (North Abydos) the research done in this project looked at recovering traces of the full range of ancient ritual activities at the site to reconstruct ancient ceremonial landscape of North Abydos. They also hoped to look at the changes in utilization of the site over time. The survey first generated topographical data and provided important insights to the history of excavation that the area had received.  This was also used to create a detailed contour map of the entire area. In 1999, Dr. Wegner had created a site that linked together all of the features of every site of Greater Abydos. The second part took into the analysis of material that was collected from the surface of the site to understand the history and range of activities that had been done in the area. The group used a program of sampling and analysis to identify changes that had happened over time in the site. Some other phases had required the usage of selective excavation, recording and analysis of certain areas of the site. This allowed the group to delve deeper into the cult of Osiris in Abydos and relate it to the events that happened in North Abydos. This excavation also helped with the understanding of the development of the ritual landscape of Abydos as a whole. Many of the artifacts that had been excavated and analyzed now reside in the University of Toronto and involves student in the analysis and interpretation of archaeological evidence. In the future, the Votive Zone Project hopes to expand on the understanding of development of ritual landscape of North Abydos. (North Abydos)

 <h3>Conclusion</h3> 
 <hr></hr> 
 <p>The Temple of Seti I at Abydos is a very important piece of archaeological framework. Since it has led to the discovery of the Abydos King’s List there has been much more insight into the past rulers from the first to the nineteenth dynasty than there had been before. Since this is one of the most complete king’s lists, there are more names that archaeologists can look into as Pharaoh or King (except for the few omitted names).  The temple can also be connected to the Temple of Rameses II, since Rameses II also had a part in the construction of the temple of Seti I. This temple can also tie the importance of Osiris in the area of Abydos, which is evident from the shrine within the temple to the Osireion located behind the temple, as well as shrines throughout the rest of the Abydos sites. This also leads the group within the North Abydos Votive Zone Project to draw inferences on the utilization of the site over time and allows archaeologists to look back in time to thousands of years ago.  </p>
