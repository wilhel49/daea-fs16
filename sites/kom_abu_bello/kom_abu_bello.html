    </figure><p>About 70km North of Cairo in the Western Delta lies the archaeological site of Kom Abu Bello.
       The site today lies partly beneath the modern village of Tarrana but in the Greco-Roman period
       the site was the location of the important trading city known as Terenouthis. Terenouthis,
       ideally placed near the Rosetta branch of the Nile in the Western Delta and situated along an
       important trading route for wine and salt made the city a significant urban center. The city is
       long gone, but the vestiges of that city remain buried in this location, perhaps most important of which is
        the necropolis. This necropolis contains burials from the Old Kingdom through the Greco-Roman Period,
       with the latter being by far the most dominant period represented. This site is known to be one of
       the richest in terms of Greco-Roman funerary finds in all of Egypt. These Greco-Roman burials have
       produced fantastic stellae and a wide variety of grave goods. Also present at the site are the remains
       of a temple to Hathor, sizable enough to be seen from satellite imagery as well as other site features
       of which have not yet been fully explained. </p>

     <h3>Regional and Geographic Setting</h3>
     <hr>
     <p>Kom Abu Bello lies about 70km north of Cairo in the Western Delta, situated between the Western Desert
       and the Rosetta Branch of the Nile. Today the modern El Nasseri Canal cuts directly through the site. The
        necropolis and the ancient city, covering a sizable area, are covered in part by modern land use. The villages
         of Tarrana, and Nasr Moustafa both cover different portions of the site and agriculture covers more. Modern
         land use continues to encroach upon the site but significant portions of the necropolis area west of the canal
         remain unoccupied<a href="#" rel="citation"
        data-toggle="popover"  data-content="Dhennin, Sylvain. (2011) “Terenouthis – Kom Abou Billou : une ville et sa Necropole”. Bulletin
           De L'institute Francais D' Archeologie Orientale 111 (2011) 105-127"> (Dhennin 2011)</a>. The numerous small mounds, piles of eroding mud brick, pottery sherds, and clear indication
         of material remains in these open areas identify the site for what it is. This area during Greco-Roman period was
         important in the wine and salt trade routes and would have dominated the Western Delta developing Terenouthis into
         a sizable and important city. As such, the associated ruins and remains of both the city and the necropolis are
         varied and spread over a wide area. </p>
          <br>
          <h3>Description</h3>
          <hr>
          <p>As previously stated, the site covers a significantly large area if one includes the city of Terenouthis,
            the necropolis, and the associated areas which relate to periods prior to the Greco-Roman period which
            Kom Abu Bello is primarily known for. But the site can be fairly easily described by its various sections
            and major features. The city of Terenouthis lies on the east side of the El Nasseri Canal. The encroachment
            of modern life and agriculture have significantly reduced the size of the site available for excavation here,
            but parts of the ancient city are easily identifiable by the uneven ground and mounds of mud brick. Evidence
            of the industrial production of amphora, potentially for salt can be seen on the surface. The city street
            grid can still be detected, at least from aerial imagery<a href="#" rel="citation"
       		 data-toggle="popover"  data-content="“Mefkat, Kom Abou Billou”.</a> Institut Francais D'Archaeologie Orientale – Le Caire. (accessed Sept 2016)"> (Mefkat, Kom Abou Billou)</a>. Just west of the ancient city, the El Nasseri Canal
            cuts across the site in a North/South direction. The Terrana bridge crosses the canal and leads one directly to
            the necropolis. The necropolis could be further divided into sections according to period. Generally it seems the
            northern parts of the necropolis are from earlier periods with Old and New Kingdom burials being found along the
            northern part of the canal<a href="#" rel="citation"
       		 data-toggle="popover"  data-content="Hawass, Zahi. (1979) “Preliminary Report on the Excavations at Kom Abou Bellou”. Studien zur Altagyptischen Kultur 7 (1979): 75-87."> (Hawass 1979)</a>. The Greco-Roman burials dominate the area directly west of the bridge. Also in this
            area lies the very large structure believed to be a temple to Hathor. The structure is large enough that it can be
            seen from satellite imagery. This area also is easily identifiable as an archaeological site from the mounds and
            piles of eroding mud brick as well as scattered sherds.</p>

               occurred in 1887 and 1888 under the Egyptian Exploration Fund, headed by F.L. Griffith. This excavation
               resulted in the discovery of the temple to Hathor in the western section of the necropolis.A second very
               short expedition headed by E. Peterson for the University of Michigan was conducted in 1935. The next major
               period of excavation at the site began in 1969. The construction of the El Nasseri Canal was laid out in a
               path directly through the site and thus a salvage excavation was undertaken to preserve and document threatened
               sections of the site. These excavations headed by various individuals lasted for roughly eight years. Shafik
               Farid of the Antiquities Department headed the first round of excavations. His excavation covered an area of
               about 4km by 170m within the necropolis<a href="#" rel="citation"

               has been recovered up until very recently. Some criticism has been aimed at the quality of documentation
               and lack of publishing from these excavations but as it was a salvage dig ahead of a public project, it is
               understandable that the teams likely had time and resource pressures. These excavations recovered burials
               ranging from the 6th Dynasty, Old Kingdom through the 4th Century AD (Greco-Roman period)<a href="#" rel="citation"

               More than 6,000 tombs were uncovered during this period, mostly from the Greco-Roman period but did include
               some from Pharaonic times. More recently excavations have been undertaken by the  French Institute of

               been undertaken to get a better understanding of the overall site as well as presumably to fill in the gaps
               created by lack of publishing and the poor documentation of previous excavations. The site continues to be
               excavated today by the IFAO and University of Lille and much of the visual material and modern interpretation
               of Kom Abu Bello will likely come from this expedition. </p>

         </figure><p>The excavations of Kom Abu Bello have recovered a wide range of materials from a variety of periods
                 and contexts. However the most thoroughly investigated elements of Kom Abu Bello have been in the Greco-Roman
                 necropolis. Thus far, there have been somewhere around 6,000 to 8,000 burials uncovered, though the incomplete
                 documentation and lack of publishing makes it difficult to verify exact numbers<a href="#" rel="citation"

                 come in a wide variety but by far the most common are burials beneath a superstructure of mud brick. The body is
                 placed in a sand pit,generally facing west, subsequently covered, and a mud-brick superstructure erected on top of
                 the burial pit. The structures come in a wide variety of styles including rectangular, oblong, round, and pyramid
                 shaped styles. Some of these are unique within Egypt, only found at Kom Abu Bello. Within the superstructures,
                 usually on the east side, is a small niche in which a funerary stelle is placed. Another smaller niche a small
                 offering table is positioned in front of this. Some of the superstructures appear to be related to one another
                 with offering tables possibly associated with multiple tombs facing each other<a href="#" rel="citation"

                 recovered from Kom Abu Bello. They are probably mass produced but are generally of good quality and can be found

                 some in sarcophagi or in wooden coffins. It has been suggested by Sylvain Dhennin that the mortuary practices
                 exhibited at Kom Abu Bello may be a mix of Egyptian and Greek or Roman practices<a href="#" rel="citation"

                 <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                 <hr>
                 <p>Kom Abu Bello really is a fascinating site that gets overlooked in Egyptian archaeology. This is
                   possibly due to the fact that the site is from the less popular Greco-Roman period or because the
                   site is not well understood or documented. Either way, it is likely there will be significant discoveries
                    made there as excavations move forward. The city remains to be excavated, which in time will likely
                    reveal interesting information about Egyptian life in the Greco-Roman period. In fact Sylvain Dhennin has
                    suggested that simply defining the period as Greco-Roman is inadequate and moving forward we can better
                    pinpoint time-spans within the period<a href="#" rel="citation"
