         <h3>Introduction</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
		 <p>el-Adaïma is a necropolis of the predynastic time period, which was between the middle and the end 
		 of the fourth millennium. It is an important archaeological site in southern Egypt, filled with series 
		 of tombs and a perfectly preserved children’s cemetery. Many archaeologists have excavated the site 
		 because it is rich in artifacts that give us a glimpse into how life was for those who lived there in 
		 the past.  Excavations of the site suggest that the area was once a very lively, industrious area filled 
		 with many people.</p>
		 <br><!--this creates a break, to separate things a little better-->

<h3>Location</h3> 
<hr>
<p>el-Adaïma is located along the west bank of the Nile, 60 km south of Luxor (25°14′56″N, 32°34′43″E) and 30 km north 
of Hierakonpolis. The site occupies part of a rise with an elevation of up to 5 m above the surrounding floodplain. </p>
<br>

<h3>Description of Site</h3>
<hr>
<p>The site consists of a badly plundered cemetery called the “Western Cemetery”; an intact cemetery, containing mainly 
children’s graves, called the “Eastern Cemetery”; and a settlement, which appears as a large area with artifacts scattered 
over the surface, extending for about 1 km along the edge of the cultivated land. The site covers about 40 ha 
(settlement: 35 ha; cemeteries: 5 ha). In all, 881 graves were discovered and excavated. From a chronological point of view, 
the Western Cemetery is older; its use is recorded from the Naqada IC period until Naqada IIID–Dynasty 3. While burial continued 
in the Western Cemetery, the first graves were dug in the southern part of the Eastern Cemetery in the Naqada IIC–IID transition 
period and continued until Dynasty 3. This indicates that, there was activity across the site spanning from Naqada IC to the end 
of Dynasty 3 (3700–2600 BC)</p>
<br>

<h3>Discussion of Excavations</h3>
The site was discovered and partly excavated in 1908 by Jacques de Morgan, and then rediscovered by Fernand Debono in 1973. 
In the winter for 1906-1907 while conducting surveys for the Brooklyn Museum, Henri de Morgan located Adaïma. De Morgan returned
the following field season (1907-1908) to continue surveying the settlement area and to conduct excavations within the two 
cemeteries he had previously pinpointed. By the close of the season, de Morgan had investigated a total of fourteen burials. 
The artifacts collected from the 1907-1908 season have been stored at the Musée d’Archéologie nationale in Saint-Germain-en-Laye 
as well as the Brooklyn Museum New York. In 1973, Fernando Debono began his additional excavations at Adaïma. Unlike Morgan, he 
focused his attention on only one of the cemeteries rather than the settlement and second cemetery. In the cemetery thirty burials 
were uncovered—however, Debono was not the first individual to expose the burials. A majority of those investigated appeared to 
have been robbed and plundered by looters during the Predynastic period. In response to the site of Adaïma’s preservation being 
threatened by sebakh and other agricultural activities, excavations have been occurring off and on from 1989 to 2005. Rescue measures 
were put into place by the director of the Institut franҫais d’archéologie ortientale, P. Posener Krieger, in conjunction with the Department 
of Antiquities. Once the site had been surveyed once again, large scale excavations took place in both the cemeteries as well as the settlement 
from 1996 to 2000. The cemetery and burial investigations were conducted by Éric Crubézy and Thierry Janin while the settlement studies were 
operated by Nathalie Buchez and Béatrix Midant-Reynes So far, 881 graves have been excavated in addition to mortars, hearths, black-topped 
wares, and living floors. The most recent excavations were carried out from 1989 until 2005 under the direction of Béatrix Midant-Reynes 
as part of the activities of the French Institute of Archaeology in Cairo. </p>

<h3>Results and significant excavations</h3>
<hr>
<p>Recent topographic and chronological analytical results based on a study of ceramics show the stages of development of the site: 
During Naqada I-IIB/IIC, there was a massive expansion in the settlement. Many people lived there and the population continued to 
grow and expand for over two centuries. Houses and different types of dwellings were being created rapidly for families to live. With 
the addition of houses and dwellings, cemeteries had to be made for the area. Excavations indicate that there was no specialized 
production unit. Full development of “elite” tombs is also indicated during Naqada IIC. Naqada IIC/IID-IIA1 is characterized with a 
decline in population. The liveliness that evolved during Naqada I-IIB/IIC slowly vanished. Different areas were abandoned, including 
areas that were along the edge of the floodplain. Areas of the cemeteries were abandoned as well. Analysis of the site also indicates 
that children’s cemeteries present palaeo-demographic data in favor of a reduced population. Excavations of the period Naqada IIA1/IIIA2-Dynasty 3 
suggest that the populations changed. The community that lived there was much smaller than that of Naqada I-IIB/IIC. It also suggests that there 
was possibly specialized production with implications for a large-scale production and redistribution system. Occupied from 3700 to 2600 BC, this site 
represents the settlement of a small community or people who had very little differences socially. The major stages in the site’s development 
appear to be closely correlated with those of the “urban centers” we see today. These major stages also contributed to the economic and political growth 
of Hierakonpolis. The decrease in population may indicate an exodus towards the “cities” such as Hierakonpolis. The result, for the Naqada III period, 
is the perseverance of the site in the form of a single production unit the end of its occupation. The analysis was based on the study of the entire 
ceramic corpus. This involved 120,000 sherds and 1240 complete vessels, of which 89 came from the settlement and 1151 from the cemeteries. All vessels 
deposited in graves had been used previously in domestic contexts and not all of the vessel forms used in settlement areas were found in graves. This 
analysis was based on the study of the entire ceramic corpus. This involved 120,000 sherds and 1240 complete vessels, of which 89 came from the 
settlement and 1151 from the cemeteries. All vessels deposited in graves had been used previously in domestic ways and not all of the vessel forms 
used in settlement areas were found in graves. Many of the graves excavated at el-Adaïma contain very well preserved skeletons, representing the people 
who once inhabited the area. In all, 881 graves yielding 800 morphologically well-preserved skeletons were excavated and studied by osteoarchaeologists 
and anthropobiologists. Excavations of the site and analysis of the remains have suggested that the people of Adaima laid very young children to rest 
inside the settlement, some of which given necessities for the afterlife and jewelry such as bracelets.  The earliest internment of six people 
(one adult, one adolescent, and four children) was prepared around 3700/3600 BCE, about the time that the first people started settling at Adaïma. 
The tomb (S55) was set on top of a small mound with no archaeological remains were discovered in the area.  All individuals of S55 died and were buried 
at the same time so that the tomb was considered as the ‘original first tomb’. After, the Western Cemetery was then used for the next 600 to 700 years 
as a final resting place. In one case, extraordinary care was taken over the placement of the bodies creating an image of love expressed by the funerary 
party as much as a gesture of tenderness between and woman and a child. In burial S11 the body of the child was place in such a way that the child’s 
neck was resting on the woman’s arm while her fingertips were touching the child’s forehead.  Members of the elite were not buried with the general 
population who were lower in status. The Eastern Cemetery is divided into a northern and southern section by a gap formed by an old wadi of around 15m width. 
The southern section contained only graves of children, many placed in vessels, and with dates around 3150/3300-3200 BCE, with younger tombs dating to around 
3150-3050 BCE. The Eastern Cemetery was only used by a small community of 10 to 30, and archeologists have speculated that they were extended family.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<hr>
<p>el-Adaïma is such an important site to the archaeological community. It is rich in cemeteries and burial sites. More than 800 graves with 800 
morphologically well-preserved skeletons have been discovered.  As a result of these excavations, more and more data are becoming available for 
Predynastic settlements. After analysis of this site, we are able to get a better understanding of what life was like for the individuals who 
lived in the area during specific time periods. The excavations of the cemeteries have helped us get a glimpse into the burial practices of the 
ancient Egyptians. We’re able to see how they buried loved ones, what possessions they left in the graves for those who passed and what those 
possessions potentially meant to them. From excavation of the Western and Eastern Cemeteries, we are able to see that there was a clear distinction 
between the elite (Western Cemetery) and the working class (Eastern Cemetery) and the huge differences in the ways in which they were buried. 
el-Adaïma, like most of the archaeological sites in Egypt (and archaeological sites in general) act as a catalyst to help us understand humankind.</p>
