Excavations at Hierakonpolis began in the late 1890s with James Quibell and Fredrick Green, and since 1967 by a handful of different institutes have been a part of intense excavations and survey expeditions. Early excavations by Quibell and Green began in 1898, and focused on a 4th millennium B.C. temple, that was contemporary with emergence of Egyptian civilization, <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content=" Shaw, Ian.

These excavations revealed some of the more prevalent artifacts discovered include the Narmer Palette and Macehead and the Scorpion Macehead in what is called the main deposit, which was placed between two walls that were dated to the Old Kingdom, <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content=" Shaw, Ian.

<br><br>Moving into the twentieth century, excavations at Hierakonpolis continued to reveal valuable artifacts and information regarding Predynastic and early Dynastic Egyptian society. The Metropolitan Museum of Art, who have for a long time shown interest in excavating a predynastic site, began excavations at Hierakonpolis in 1933 and continued through 1944, <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content=" Lansing, Ambrose.

Throughout excavations at Hierakonpolis it has become evident that the strategic location of the city led to trade relations with Sudan, Sub-Saharan Africa, and the mineral resources of the eastern desert, <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content=" Castillos, Juan J.

">(Lansing 37)</a>. Excavation at Hierakonpolis has revealed a lot about predynastic culture, including how when summer rains decreased in the dessert, thus causing inundations of the Nile river to decrease, settlement moved closer to the water,  <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content=" Hoffman, Michael Allen. Culture History and Cultural Ecology at Hierakonpolis from the Paleolithic Times. (1971): n. pag. Print.
">(Hoffman 73)</a>.  Multiple artifacts have also indicated the importance of Hierakonpolis in the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt. Artifacts such as the Narmer Palette and Macehead and the Scorpion Macehead help to tell the story of unification in Egypt, <a href="#" rel="citation" data-toggle="popover" data-content=" Shaw, Ian. Exploring Ancient Egypt. New York, NY: Oxford UP, 2003. Google Books. Web. 5 Nov. 2016.

The Egyptian Predynastic and State Formation. Journal of Archaeological Research 24.4 (2016): 421-68. Web.">(Stevenson 433)</a>.
