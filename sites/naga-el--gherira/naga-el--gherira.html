      <h1>Gebelein</h1>
      <h3>Late Predynastic to Middle Kingdom</h3>
	  <h4>Katelyn Mueller</h4>
         <h3>Introduction</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
		 <p>The site Gebelein, more commonly known today as Naga el-Gherira, is an ancient Egyptian site dated from the late Predynastic to the Middle Kingdom. The ancient Egyptian name of the site, "Jnr.tj,” stands for “between two rocks.” The Greco-Roman people called this place Aphroditopolis or Pathiris, referring to the goddess Hathor- identified as the Greek goddess Aphrodite- for whom the temple was built.
The first record of this site was in Description de l’Egypte, when Napoleon set out on his Egyptian expedition. Excavations have continued through the present, where work is currently being done to completely map the site.</p>
		 <br><!--this creates a break, to separate things a little better-->
	     <h3>Location</h3>
		 <hr>
		 <p>The site of Gebelein is to be found around 30 km south of Thebes, to the west of the Nile river. It’s exact location is 29°29’ N, 32°29’ E. The site is located between two large hills of stone, which is where the name “Jnr.tj” comes from. The site contains a cemetery that hasn’t been entirely excavated yet that can be found on the northern hill. In the cemetery the Predynastic tombs are located on the northern edge of the hill and are essentailly holes in the ground. The Dynastic tombs are located on the slant of the hill because the tombs are cut into the stone. The Temple of Hathor is located on the other hill, the southern one. The current town, overlaying the ancient town, was on the west side of the southern hill and spread out towards the north.

		<br>
		In general, Gebelein is a very sandy, rocky site, as can be seen in image 1. The ground is sparsely covered in bushes and short grasses, but the climate is very dry and arid. 
		</p>
		<br>
	    <h3>Excavations</h3>
		<hr>
		<p>As described before, this site was first observed by Napoleon and his team of scientists in the early 19th century. It was published in Description de l’Egypte for the public to consume. Interest must have arisen from this because the site was excavated almost continually for the next 200 years. It’s important to note that, as with many other Egyptian sites, this site was had been heavily grave robbed and can not entirely encompass everything this site represented for this community and society.
		<br>
		<br>
		Numbers of French archaeologists excavated this site for a number of reasons in the late 1800s. Some following archaeologist Gaston Maspero, some in association with the Egypt Exploration Fund in 1893. Items from these excavations can be found in museums in Cairo, Berlin, and Lyons. Later, excavations were conducted in a systematic manner by Ernesto Schiaparelli and his successor, Giulio Farina, in the name of the Egyptian Museum, Turin. </p>

		<h3> Results of Excavations </h3>
		<hr>
		<p>
		The Schiaparelli and Farina team were one of the first to excavate the Temple of Hathor, which some have said is the most important find of the whole site. Within this temple, the team found and excavated a mudbrick wall containing cartouches of High Priest Menkhepere. From this wall they could find many wall reliefs dating to the 11th dynasty. Also found were royal stelae that dated to the 2nd-3rd dynasties and one came from the New Kingdom. There were also about 400 Demotic and Greek ostraca found, and other text written on papyrus and skins in either Greek or Coptic.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>Schiaparelli’s group also excavated the northern hill at Gebelein, where they found many tombs from different dynasties, including a 4th dynasty tomb of Perim, his funerary equipment, and his coffin which was heavily decorated. Also found was the funerary equipment of First Intermediate Period Pharaoh Iti’s wife, Neferu. Farina’s group also found painted linens whose themes matched those on some vases (many of which have boat motifs that were very popular in Ancient Egypt) and five papyri from the Old Kingdom. These papyri provided priceless administrative information; these were found in a box placed near a decorated coffin.</p>
		<br>
		<p>The tombs of Iti and Ini were found in the cemeteries of Gebelein. Iti was an ‘overseer of desert expeditions’ in the 6th dynasty and Ini was a nomarch from the 10th dynasty. Interestingly, neither of these individuals were pharaohs or a part the royal family, but both were found buried along with many rich funeral goods. In another tomb from the 11th dynasty there were many paintings that depicted rituals and everyday life. The style that these were painted in is reminiscent of the First Intermediate Period. These tombs, both Predynastic and Dynastic were excavated most heavily by Schiaparelli’s group and Gaston Maspero’s group.. Along with the tombs the two groups also found intricately painted and inscribed sarcophagi, stone tools, black-topped red ware, figurines, and small wooden ship models.</p>

<p>Probably one of the most famous and important expeditions to this site happened in the 1890s. Sir Wallis Budge, from the British Museum, went to Egypt to bring back artifacts for the museum. He and his team ended up finding, though some sources use the term ‘buying’, six Predynastic mummies. One of these mummies has come to be known as ‘Gebelein Man’ and he has resided in the British Museum for more than 100 years. This mummy is extraordinary because he is preserved extremely well. Gebelein Man also still had some hair on his head, red, and all his internal organs, including his brain, still intact. In 2012 Gebelein Man was CT-scanned and it was found that he most likely died between 18 and 21 and that he was murdered due to a stab wound in the back (Gebelein Man). Currently, the Gebelein Man exhibit in the museum features a touchscreen display that allows you to digitally strip away layers of skin, muscle, bone, etc. from the mummy to analyze different parts of it. In addition, you can cut cross sections to view at different angles. The other mummies, one woman, three men, and one with an undeclared sex, were found just like Gebelein Man was – in the fetal position on their left sides with their heads to the south so they’re facing the west which is the Land of the Dead. All of them were found in separate, shallow graves and each was found with some grave goods like pots. A few of the mummies were covered with reed matting and animal skins. These mummies were important finds because they gave more insight into the mummification process and variation in mummification techniques according to wealth.</p>

<h3> Conclusion </h3>
<hr>
<p>Gebelein/Naga el-Gherira has served as many things over the years, giving the site a lot of importance due to the information that can come from it. The site has been occupied by a royal estate, a mercenary recruitment center, a garrison settlement, and a military post. Although the site may not be the most discussed in popular media or texts, it still has a lot to offer us in an archaeological and historical context.</p>
<br>
<p>Every artifact and structure in the site, every grave and piece of the Temple of Hathor, can tell archaeologists something about the story of these ancient peoples. The site was occupied, and still is, for thousands of years, so there is near endless information to be analyzed from the materials excavated. The fact that it was occupied during the Predynastic makes it especially useful, given that we have the least information for this range of time in ancient Egyptian history. Archaeologists have to rely on the current people of Naga el-Gherira to not expand onto, and effectively destroy, the archaeological site here. Archaeologists will continue to excavate and analyze here to draw the full story out of these material remains.</p>
