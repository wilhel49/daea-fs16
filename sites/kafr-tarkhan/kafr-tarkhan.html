</figure><p>The site of Kafr Tarkhan is an ancient necropolis that is near the entrance into the Fayum.  This ancient Egyptian cemetery dates to the time of Naqada III in late presynaptic to late dynastic period (3300-2900 B.C.E) Egypt that also includes the time of the Famous Narmer.  This site was well excavated by the father of “relative dating” Sir Wiilliam Mathew Flinders Petrie during 1911-1914 In two season that are referred to Tarkhan I, and Tarkhan II.  Flinders Petrie also found several royal mudbrick mastabas and several burials that had inscribed royal names.  He also found an extensive amount in grave goods at the Tarkhan site such as alabaster dishes, pottery (jugs and jars), and ornate Ivory spoons and dishes in elite graves and copper tools.  One of the newest and greatest finds at the Tarkhan site is the what is called the “Tarkhan dress” that is estimated to be 5,000 years’ old.  The interesting part about the dress is it was an afterthought and was stored away in Flinders Petrie collection to not be seen again until just in recent years the rediscovery of what is known as the “Tarkhan Dress” has made headlines in the world of Egyptian Archaeology as extraordinary find due to the rare nature of finding an intact linin textile clothes.</p>  
<br>
<h3>Introduction to Location and Geography</h3>
<hr>
<p>The location of the Kafr Tarkhan site is near the west bank of the Nile in the Fayum region.  Tarkhan site is about 37 miles south of Cairo (Petrie, <em>Seventy years in Archaeology</em>). The name of Kafr Tarkhan came from a nearby village to help distinguish the site from some roman era sites nearby and later the name Kafr Ammar came from the nearest railroad station during Flinder Petrie second season of Archaeological digging in Tarkhan II (Mawdsley 2).  The area of Tarkhan cemetary is a very large spread out site that ranges for about two mile (1).  Also, geographically there is a natural wadi that cuts through the site giving its local name of “Hill and Valley Cemeteries” (1).   of Petrie the site was more of a arid desert seen with the Nile flora and palm trees about half mile away from the site as depicted in a photograph taken (Wilkinson 9).  Today’s Tarkhan Archaeological site is all but invisible due to the large Farming community that has risen in the area and what was once as stated a more arid area of desert is now lush and fertile soil thanks to extensive irrigation system and drainage canals put in place to draw water from the Nile into the area to allow for farming for both domestic consumption and industrial consumption (Said 221).  Also, as of today there are several small town near the Tarkhan site as of today Sidi Muhammad Al Iraqi, Kafr El-Refaey and the town it was named after Kafr Tarkhan Ash Sharqi.</p>
<br>
<h3>Description of Site Past and Present</h3>
<hr>
<p>When Flinders Petrie and his colleagues started to work on the Kafr Tarkhan site it was in 1911-1912 (Petrie Seventy Years in Archaeology 241).  The second season started in 1913 and ended in 1914 after exhausting the site and moving southward into the Fayum area (Petrie, <em>Tarkhan II</em>). they broke it up the time periods into three Late Naqata III-Dynasty 0, Dynasty I, and lastly Dynasty II (Petire, <em>Tarkhan I and Memphis</em> V).  The reigning periods that were found at the site were of Narmer, Aha Zer, and Zet and many grave goods of the reign of Merneit, Den, and Azab (3). Some of the interesting depiction of the site was that there were some clear showings of inequality in grave styles where some of the working-class people of the time would be buried in reed baskets while other of official or people of higher class would have been buried in ornate wooden coffins.  Then you also had the ruling class royal tombs that were buried under mastabas. (4)  One of the problems that was mentioned at the site was it was hard to distinguish time periods due to mixing of grave goods in graves that some individual where buried with that had most likely been heirlooms and prized objects form past years kept and then buried with certain individuals.  As of today, the site Kafr Tarkhan is not active and has been for the most part surrounded by farming commun.</p>

<h3>Discussion of Excavation</h3>
<hr>

<p>Some of the main people that worked at the site during the four-year span of time at the Tarkhan site were other than Petrie were his wife, Ernest Mackay (who worked a lot with Petrie during the Tarkhan II season of 1913), Reginal Engelback (who also contributed greatly to the field of Archaeology), and several other students that came in the second season during Tarkhan II   (Petrie, <em>Tarkhan I and Memphis V,</em>,; Petrie, <em>Takhan II</em>,).  When discussing the Tarkhan site it is worth noting that the cemetery spans about a 400 year and many of the finds by Petrie during his excavation for the Naqada III presynaptic to dynasty zero burials were divided up buy class, with elites buried hills while commoners were buried in the wadi valley      (MacArthur 8).  One of the interesting facts was that Petrie found several royal grave mastabs or king tombs that were chambered off with many ornate grave goods (Petrie, <em>Tarkhan I and Memphis V</em>).

  With the Royal tombs and many commoner reed basket coffin burials Petrie concluded that Tarkhan may have been the capital before it got moved to Memphis (Petrie, Tarkhan II).  Petrie also found many vassels and pottery that had similar inked inscription from Abydos. One Petrie’s biggest finds was in grave 44 which had a vessel with the serekhs for Narmar on it (Petrie Tarkhan I and Memphis V).</p>

<figcaption>Image 3 - Tarkhan Coffin</figcaption>

</figure><p>Petrie’s colleague Engelback also found on the dig during Tarkhan I in grave 415 a wooden coffin badly decayed were two alabaster jars; a slate palette before the remains hands and near the hands of the individual was a cylinder jar inscription of Narmer (Petrie, Tarkhan I and Memphis V).  Engelback also found several other box coffin burials and several mastabas as well along with several other burials that had been robbed in ancient times.</p> 

 
<p>It was also noted by Petrie was seeing more and more especially in mastaba tombs and commoner graves goods that were coming from both lower and upper Egypt and later into tombs and graves on the first dynasty more grave quality of lower Egypt which meant a closer tie to unification.</p>

</figure>

<p>well to note that Since the time of Flinders Petrie’s last excavation at the Karf Tarkhan site there has been no major digging there since.  But what has happened as of the last twenty years is a review of older finds at the site that were a part of Petrie’s collection such as the “Tarkhan Dress” which was excavated in 1912 during Tarkhan I (Johnstone par 2).  The dress was found in mastaba 2050 by Petrie himself, and was assumed to be dated around 3100-2890 B.C.E (3) The British Museum Research Laboratory stated under their reexamining of the dress they believe it is more from fifth dynasty of 2494-2345 than the earlier date (4).  It is important to understand that such things like actual clothes like that are a very rare find and that is why in its rediscovery it has made news in places like Archaeology Magazine. This type of rediscovery has brought new interest into idea of the Tarkhan site like Archaeologist of Egypt like Lisa Mawsley.  In is has also been found that the Abydos and Tarkhan have shared similar artifats like cylindrical vessels containing mud/oil, sented fat, and ash as economic goods being traded to lower during the early predynastic around the time of unification (MacArther 5).</p>
<br>

<h3>Results and significance of the excavation</h3>
<hr>
Results of Flinders Petrie and others have brought up the idea that Tarkhan was a major hub for intersection of influence with Abydos and in some cases connections to Hierakronpolis with the serekhs of Narmer inscribed on vessels.  This proves that Tarkhans shows significance of it being a possible capitol for a time and part of the evolution of Egypt into statehood.  Petrie’s finds like different grave style showed in the predynastic the changes of inequality of grave goods and that with span of time of 400 years Tarkhan had acquired a vast wealth of information of a changing people of Egypt. It has recently sparked interest by Archealogist like Mawsley that may possible reopen the site to a younger bunch of Archaeologist that pick up where Petrie left off.</p>  
<br>

<h3>Conclusion importance of site</h3>
<hr>
<p>The Tarkhan site played a major role in Egyptian Archaeology with the understanding of the slow process of unification and with the showing of styles of graves and grave goods the issue of social inequality dating back to the Naqada III period.  It is unfortunate that it is only recently that any attention has been given to the site since the time of Flinders Petrie last excavated it in 1914.  Hopefully with new Archaeologist like Lisa Mawdsley more people will interested and the site might see new excavation in the future.</p>
