      <h1>Heracleopolis</h1>
      <h3>Early Dynastic until Roman Period</h3>
	  <h4>By:Emily Davila</h4>
         <h3>Introduction</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
		 <p>With the exact boundaries unknown and written about by the greats, Ptolemy and Strabo, located more precisely between the Nile on the east, Bahr Yusuf on the west, and with two transversal canals cut along the valley, lies the ancient city of Heracleopolis Magna
(Neville, 1894; 20). During the Coptic period, the Heracleopolis was known as Ahnas, later transitioning to Henassiet el Medineh, and officially established as Ihnasiyyah al-Madinah; it has changed both political and religious influences throughout the shifts. </p>
<p>	In addition to the unknown exact parameters of the ancient city, the founding date is also a mystery, and due to limited physical and written documents remains a difficult task to uncover. However, it is known that the site was in critical power during the VIIIth and XIth Dynasties. Notably, during excavation of the tombs of Sioot, typically attributed to the Xth Dynasty, it described the wars that occurred in honor of the Heracleopolitan regent, and entails the lengths went to protect the nation and citizens from those in Thebes (Neville, 1894; 17-18).</p>
<p>Uniquely, the city also partook in a tale dating back to possibly even earlier than the suspected Dynasties. In the tale, it describes dispute between a peasant and a huntsman, who undoubtedly robs the peasant and was reported to the officials. The officials, in particular the high steward known as Merutensa at Heracleopolis, handled the affair whist also proclaiming the authority to transfer the issue to the king (Neville, 1894; 18). Although this may be true, due to the fact that it is neither a historical document or written on a legitimized item, it proves little more than the acknowledgement that is was a city worthy of tales.</p>

     <h3>Geography and Setting</h3>
      <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
     <p>Coupled with the fact that the city was written about by Strabo and Ptolemy, it also became a place of importance to Greek emperors, correspondingly having sites of numerous Coptic churches, of which are of large proportions. The island of Heracleopolis, during its pinnacle, is relatable to the village in front of Luxor. It arose to being an island, from a division of the river, being that the river fluctuates in both direction and size, it is not uncommon that the river describes by the great writers to not be the current Bahr Yusuf branch. </p>
<p>In addition to the church sites, mounds were also vastly found throughout the outer edges of the site. The mound sizes, extending over an area of 360 acres, ranged from large being decayed houses to small pieces of stone scattered about. In view of the vast stretch encompassed by the mounds, they became popularly known as Omm el Keman, the <em> Mother of Mounds </em>. Of those mounds, the oldest appears to date from the XIIIth Dynasty, however, upon further investigation of the mounds, the bulk of it appears to be waste land from the earlier inhabitants. </p>
<p>Kom el Dinar, one particular mound, large enough to span several hamlets and villages currently, has four columns standing in the front of a village, resulting from an earlier Roman or Byzantine monument. Likewise, two abandoned saltpetre pits were also discovered, surprisingly, they were used in the manufacturing of gunpowder in the 18th centaury (Neville, 1894; 17).</p>

          <h3> Site Description </h3>
       <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->

     </figure>
     <p>Heracleopolis, being not only situated upon a water branch, was also a city that help prestigious religious power, even throughout political shifts. That power, stems from the deep connection to the Egyptian’s Book of the Dead as well as its scriptural importance during one’s afterlife as well as the god, Osiris. In the Book of the Dead and simplified by Edouard Neville, Heracleoplis is utilized as the location of which “the coronation of Osiris and of his son took place. It is said that the royal crown was given to Osiris on the day when he was ordained to the leadership of the gods, which is the day <em>when the two earths were joined.</em> Horus also was ordained to succeed his father on the day of the burial of Osiris, <em>the beneficent soul which resides in Hunensuten.</em> (Neville, 1894; 24)” It also implies that Heracleopolis itself, is the location in which the rising of the firament, which according to text, caused the Earth to become solid (Neville, 1894; 24). Furthermore, it is also associated with the distribution of mankind, due to being the origin of the goddess <em> Sehket</em>, “when she went out to trample upon the blood of the rebels, after she had destroyed them by the command of Ra” (Neville, 1894; 24).</p>

     </figure>
     <p>The most compelling evidence of the powerful relationship between the Book of the Dead and Heracleopolis’ religious power, is the remains of the temple dedicated to a form of Osiris, also known as <em>Hershef</em>. Interestingly, when the Greeks later transcribed the Egyptian deities into greek names, the name transitioned from Hershef to Hercules, thus rendering the site from the city of Hershef to Heracleopolis (Neville, 1894; 23). The appearance of Hershef, is typically viewed as an individual with a ram’s head whist bearing the head-dress of Osiris. Provided that there are few representations found in the temple, “he is routinely shown with a human head; of Harmakhis, with a hawk’s head bearing the solar disk; of <em>Horus neb ma kheru</em>, Horns the justified, or rather the victorious lord, having a hawk’s head with the double diadem; and also of Tum” (Neville, 1894; 23). With such strong religious ties, the city’s rise and fall is understandable with the shifting worship of deities, especially in locations of political importance as well as the Pharaoh’s beliefs. </p>
<br>
<h3> Excavations and Results </h3>
     <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
 <p>As a result of the city’s close ties with religion, its critical to understand the temple in a more complete context, in hopes of gaining new knowledge of the legacy and lifestyle of Heracleopolitians. During the initial discovery by French archaeologist Jomard as well as the identification combined with the knowledge gained Edouard Naville, T. Hayter Lewis, J. J. Tylor, and F. Ll. Griffith, excavations and research were compiled about the historical and physical importance. In the middle, resided a rectangular hall, the front containing a row of six granite columns. Those columns, containing a length of more than sixty feet also hid door in the middle, that provided access to the temple. The columns were parallel to the longer side of the building, whilst the smaller side comprised of columns of only twenty-five feet long. The vestibule had a basement that constituted of hard red stone, which corresponded to the white limestone walls (Neville, 1894; 25). The colonnade on the western side of the temple, also consisted of six granite columns of more than seventeen feet in height as well as having pal-leaf capitals. The shafts were of particular craftsmanship, due to the intricate detailing of scenes depicting local divinities, offerings, and Ramses II.</p>

 <figcaption>Image 3 - "The columns and architraves from the vestibule of the temple."</figcaption>

 </figure>
 <p>The scenes depicting offerings included goods such as frankincense, milk, wine and cakes (Neville, 1894; 26). Unfortunately, due to the lack of limestone preservation the state of the temple is less than glorious of other temples, but is also believed to have been rebuilt in the 18th Dynasty and refurbished in the 19th Dynasty (Wada, 2007; 352).</p>
<p>In addition to the temple, Neville and the team also were able to uncover a portion of the Necropolis, also known as Gebel Ssedment. The tombs of which ranged from shallow graves to wealthy carved spaces in the sandy and rock ridge nearby. In reality, due to the large populations speculated at the site, the true size of the Necropolis may be hidden and more expeditions needed to further explore the depth and range of those buried. Inside one of the wealthier tombs found, “on the right of the entrance to one of the chambers were two baskets, one of which contained two alabaster pots, a comb, a kohl-case, a pin, a small pot of black earthenware with a handle, and a fine perfume spoon, the handle of which represents a girl among the reeds” were found. In like manner, “the other basket, also contains a black pot, a pin, a kohl-case, and another spoon, the handle of which consists of two Bes gods standing back to back. Besides this was a small square box, in which two porcelain rings- one of them bearing the name of Amenophis III., the other with the sacred eye- a small blue frog were found along with two small scarabs (Neville, 1894; 27)”.</p>

<figcaption>Image 4 - "Mummy cases from the Necropolis at Ssedment."</figcaption>

</figure>
<p>Contrastingly in an area known for smaller pits, a small unornamented rectangular box was found. Nearby the box, “vases of coarse red pottery and sometimes small wooden figured, which seen to have belonged to a boat and its crew; also plain wooden head-rests, and a hoe-the wooden instrument” were found as well (Neville, 1894; 29). The differences in grave goods most likely corresponds to the social class of the individual or individual’s family. Although Neville can be harsh in his descriptions of some of the mummies discovered, “some of the coffins were typically very ugly. Most of them contained the bodies of women, and the mummies were wrapped in much cloth, without any amulets. Some of them had the single ornament of a necklace of small shells and blue beads, from which hung a porcelain image of Bastit (Neville, 1894; 29)”. It highlights not only the antiquity mindset during the time period, but also interesting findings that a majority of female mummies were left, which may or may not have been buried with male counterparts nearby. As with most of the site, the exact dates and time periods are unknown, but due to the ranges in finds, provokes the idea that the Necropolis had been used and reused several times by the community.</p>

    <h3> Conclusion </h3>
  <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
  <p> <p>Heracleopolis not only provides further context of the physical relationship Egyptian’s had between religious and physical political power, even during Intermediate Periods. Through temples and local deities, everyday citizens had reminders of not only their leader’s strength but their own personal ties to the gods, through the landscape and texts shown on the temples and columns. In addition to the writings, the proximity to the river provided key logistical advantages that provided increased leverage over rival Thebes, during times of unsolidified government. Even as powers shifted through political capitals, Heracleopolis produced two Dynasties that provided stability as well as platform for later periods to utilize. For instance, Ramses II reiterated his divine connection through scenes on the earlier columns along with the Coptic’s choice of location for numerous churches. To withstand the stand of time, from Early Dynastic to the Roman Period, a site must have a site worthy of religious significance, tactical advantage, political advantage, and the ability to be reinvented over shifts in power and social change. </p>
