      <h3>Protohistory to the Coptic Era</h3>
	  <h4>Lauren St. George</h4>
         <h3>Introduction</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->

<p>Abu Roash is an archaeological site located in the ancient royal Memphite necropolis. It is a site that was used almost exclusively as a mortuary center covering different periods from protohistory to the Coptic era (IFAO). The site is home to a 4th dynasty pyramid complex and possibly shows signs of the rise in the solar cult that became most prevalent throughout Egypt in the following dynasty (Bauval & Brophy). Unfortunately, though, this site is often forgotten and is in danger from urbanization and quarrying (IFAO).</p>
       <h3>Site Description </h3>
   <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
   <p>Composed of mainly funerary structures Abu Roash resides within the ancient Memphite necropolis which is home to many of the most popular sites in Egypt. Abu Roash is a site that spans different periods from protohistory to the Coptic era (IFAO). Known best for the mortuary complex of Djedefre it resides at an elevation higher than the rest of Giza. The pyramid is now in ruins due to extensive quarrying throughout the years which was reported as ongoing by Flinders Petrie when he came to Abu Roash (Tristant & Smythe). There is evidence, despite the quarrying, that suggests that the pyramid was covered with a layer of polished red granite and limestone (Alchin). There is a Mortuary temple and a Valley temple on the eastern side of the pyramid and on the southern side of the pyramid there is a boat pit (Bunson). Abu Roash also includes a large cemetery dating back to the First Dynasty where high-ranking individuals of mid-Dynasty 1 chose to make Abu Roash their final resting place (Tristant & Smythe) (Abrams).</p>

<h3>Regional and Geographical Location</h3>
<hr>
<p>Abu Roash is located on an elevation higher than the rest of Giza (Alchin). The site is oriented with the Wadi el-Hassana to the south and the Nile Valley to the east. The site of Giza is 8 km to the north-east of the site and is the northernmost pyramid site within the Memphis Necropolis (Tristant & Smythe). The elevation of Abu Roash has created speculation that the pyramid of Djedefre could have been seen from Heliopolis on the other side of the Nile River and that this was the reason for its location being separate from the pyramids at Giza (Alchin).</p>

<h3>Geology of Abu Roash</h3>
<hr>
<p>The recorded geologic stratigraphy of Abu Roash ranges in age from Late Cretaceous to Quaternary yet has several areas of unconformities. The sedimentary environment of Abu Roash is characterized by inconsistent conditions including lower mixed, upper intertidal flat, subtidal channel, and calm to agitated open marine platform (Mansour).</p>


<h3>Excavations</h3>
<hr>
<p>The site of Abu Roash was described by many Europeans during the 19th century. Voyagers like
J. Perring and R. Lepsius made drawings and took notes on what they saw. J. Perring in 1873 visited and simply made drawings of the area and from 1842-1843, R. Lepsius recorded the pyramid along with a second mud brick pyramid. Lepsius also took note of the dynasty 1 mastabas from what would later be known as the M Cemetery. William Matthew Flinders Petrie also spent time at Abu Roash. From 1880-1882 Petrie dug a trench inside the pyramid and reported that the monument was disappearing and had been subject to quarrying (Tristant & Smythe).</p>
<p>The first true Archaeological excavation at the site was when the Institut Français
d’Archéologie Orientale (IFAO) sent Émile Chassinat to the site from December of 1900 to April of 1901. Under Chassinat, the eastern side of the pyramid was cleared and fragments of quartzite statuary were found. Some of the fragments bore inscriptions that led to the acknowledgment of the monument to Radjedef (IFAO). After Chassinat there were a few years of little to no work but in 1912 and 1913 work recommenced under Pierre Lacau. Lacau was aware that the pyramid was not the only monument in the area and that the remains in the vicinity could also be of interest so he entrusted Montet with excavation on eastern part of plateau.</p>
<p>In 1913 & 1914 Pierre Montet conducted excavations at the western-most end of the Abu Roash plateau. This area is known as the “M Cemetery” in his honor. The necropolis is situated on a small hill close to the edge of the cultivation and is believed to have been used exclusively during the reign of Den, a pharaoh who ruled in the middle of Dynasty 1, between 3350 and 2920 BC. What Montet found was 14 mud-brick mastabas with niched facades. The objects he found within these were sent to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, the Louvre Museum in Paris and to the collection of Strasbourg University in France (Tristant & Smythe). In 1922, Ferdinand Bisson de la Roque was entrusted to study the neighboring Old Kingdom necropolis (IFAO). </p>
<p>The work on the predynastic cemetery and M Cemetery was continued by members from the Leiden Museum of Antiquities led by Adolf Klasens. From 1957 to 1959 Klasens was focused on the excavation of the M Cemetery and uncovered seven more mastabas of Dynasty 1 date. he also revealed four Early Dynastic cemeteries at the bottom of the hill at the edge of a cultivation. They spanned from Dynasty 0-Dynasty 2 and contained high quantities of stone and pottery vessels (Tristant & Smythe). In the middle of the 1990s “excavations began again on the funerary complex of the 4th dynasty Pharaoh [Djedefre] as part of a joint project involving the IFAO and the University of Geneva. Work was also done, until 2007, on the elite cemetery to the north-west of the pyramid” (IFAO).</p>

<h3>Cemetery M</h3>
  <hr>
  <p>Cemetery M is an Early Dynastic burial plot located on small rock outcrop on the northwestern plain of Abu Roash. It is home to 25 raw brick tombs. The discovery of this cemetery is a significant event in the history of Early Dynastic research because it was uncovered a quarter of a century prior to the excavation of the Saqqara necropolis making it the first time that tombs similar to those identified at Abydos were encountered. It is believed to be a cemetery of social elite and further examination of the site has provided more information about the funerary architecture present in the 1st Dynasty. The ability to compare the data from excavations of more contemporary cemeteries in the Memphis region is extremely important to gather a full understanding of the cultural dynamics of Early Dynastic communities in this area (IFAO).</p>


<h3>Mortuary Complex of Djedefre</h3>
  <hr>
  <p>The investigations on the site of the mortuary complex aim to re-evaluate the reign of Djedefre. There are many unsubstantiated or under-substantiated claims that this was the site of an unfinished pyramid (IFAO) or that it was located here because of a family squabble or the beginning of a solar cult (Bauval & Brophy). When researchers looked closer at this area they realized that there had been more demolition and quarrying at the site than previously believed. This amount of destruction led researchers to consider the likelihood of this being a completed royal pyramid. The idea that the pyramid may have been completed led to the research into other components that would make up a royal funerary complex at this site.</p>
<p>The pyramid itself is similar in dimensions to the pyramid of Menkaure at Giza with sides 106 m long and standing at 67 m high. A longitudinal cut has revealed the size of the inner core of the pyramid. The interior layout preserved the T form of similar pyramids and after some excavation a descending passage and a central shaft designed to hold the royal vault was uncovered. Researchers were only able to uncover only a few traces of the sepulchral chamber which was likely demolished in the Roman era during their quarrying of the site.</p>
<p>The pyramid was not the only part of the mortuary complex that was looked into. Two boundary walls were also found containing 9 monumental entrances. Five other structures were also discovered to be connected to the mortuary temple. Researchers also examined two rows of houses and a line of shops surrounding a courtyard on the eastern side of pyramid, a building that held a boat-shaped cavity in its basement south-west of pyramid and an entrance into a paved courtyard to the west. This courtyard had porticoes leading to a hypostyle hall and chapels that once held statues of the royal family. The chapel dedicated to the royal cult stood south of this space.</p>
<p>A smaller satellite pyramid was also examined. It stood within boundary walls and is recorded to have 10.5m long sides. Researchers believe that it was a religious pyramid re-used for the burial of a queen, probably a daughter of Kufu and wife of Djedefre. This pyramid was looted in antiquity yet some of the funerary material had remained in situ.  A limestone female sarcophagus and calcite canopic jars, along with several elements of funeral accoutrements and calcite fragments of a large vase that has now been restored. This vase bears on its inside a line of hieroglyphs followed by the cartouche of Khufu (IFAO).</p>
<p>In 2007 the final campaign on site marked the completion of investing further into the relocation of the eastern exterior wall, creating a partial reconstruction of the housing within the eastern area of the cult site and the completion of all architectural drawings and surveys that would be necessary for the eventual publication of this project and its data.</p>
<p>With all of the data from the different excavations on the mortuary complex of Djedefre the most recent evaluation suggests that Djedefre’s reign previously believed to be rather short lasted between 22 and 23 years. This time would allow for Djedefre to have completed the funerary complex of his predecessor at Giza but also complete his own pyramid at Abu Roash. This discovery has led to the addition of an underappreciated time and the rewriting of the history of Ancient Egypt in this area (IFAO).</p>

  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <hr>
  <p>Abu Roash is a site that spans many years and has much information still to give. With evidence of multiple time periods archeologists and Egyptologists are getting a unique opportunity to discover the development of a site. Djedefre’s mortuary complex can possibly give information about the rise of the solar cults. The destruction of what remains of the Abu Roash monuments and the threat of urban development increases with every year making it more important than ever to gather a record of the site and its historic value.</p>
